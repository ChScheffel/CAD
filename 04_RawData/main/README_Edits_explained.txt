On the 6th of February 2023, we downloaded the REDCap data as a .csv file ("Questionnaire_Data_Original.csv") to make some changes to the otherwise protected data fields.
This file is called "Questionnaire_Data_Edits_in_yellow.xlsx" and all changed cells are highlighted in yellow.

These are the changes that were made:

1. All entries in the "set" field of the edited version contain the appendix "_final".
2. Participant codes that varied between the version supplied by the participant online and the version typed into REDCap by the instructor were unified to adhere to the formula.
3. Answers that were collected on paper due to technical failures or misunderstandings during the session were put into the respective cells (concerns some demographic questionnaires, NASA-TLXs, and follow-ups T2).
4. All entries by the instructors in the "note" fields were translated into English.
5. Entries by the instructors in the "note" fields that are not relevant for data analysis were removed (e.g. being impressed by the n-back performance).
6. All text field entries by the participants were translated into English.

This edited data file was then re-uploaded into REDCap with a .csv called "Questionnaire_Data_Edits.csv".
Then, a complete file containing both the original and the edited data was downloaded from REDCap, called "Questionnaire_Data_Full_Version.csv".
Both the full file with the original and edited data, as well as a shorter file with only the edited data, will be supplied on the OSF for full transparency of the changes that were made.

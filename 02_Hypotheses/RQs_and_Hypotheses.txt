Research Questions for t1 (COG-ED):

1. Can the revised COG-ED paradigm capture a person's actual preferences better?
a) For participants high in NFC, the subjective value curve is right skewed. (i.e. 1-back has a lower value than 2-back)
b) For participants low in NFC, the subjective value curve is exponential. (i.e. 1-back has the highest value)

2. Can we replicate findings of Westbrook et al. (2013)?
a1) There is a significant positive correlation between NFC and the AUC of the subjective value between 2-back and 4-back [Replication].
a2) There is no correlation between NFC and the AUC of the subjective value between 1-back and 4-back [Extension].
b) In a multiple regression with AUC as the second predictor, the NTLX (task load questionnaire) cannot predict NFC.
c) In a multiple regression with NTLX as the second predictor, the AUC can predict NFC.

3. Can we replicate findings of Kramer et al. (2021)?
a) Association of NFC and subjective value disappears when n-back performance is added as a covariate.

Research Questions for t2 (ER-ED):

4. What are individual subjective values of emotion regulation strategies?
a) The individual subjective values of ER strategies is negatively correlated with the respective subjective effort rating
b) ...

5. Individual subjective values of ER strategies are related to personality traits:
a)

Research Questions for t1 (COG-ED):

1. Associations of subjective and objective task load measures:
a) Performance measured by signal detection d’ declines with increasing n-back level.
b) Performance measured by reaction time declines with increasing n-back level.
c) Ratings on all NTLX subscales increase with increasing n-back level.

2. Associations of task load and effort discounting:
a) Subjective values decline with increasing n-back level.
b) Subjective values decline with increasing n-back level, even after controlling for declining task performance measured by signal detection d’ and reaction time.

3. Individual differences in effort discounting:
a) Subjective values predict individual NCS scores.
b) [New:] Subjective values for lower and higher n-back levels are negatively and positively associated with individual NCS scores, respectively.
c) NTLX scores do not predict individual NCS scores.
d) [New:] The NTLX subscales effort and mental load predict individual NCS scores.


Research Questions for t2 (ER-ED):

4. What are individual subjective values of emotion regulation strategies?
a) The individual subjective values of ER strategies are negatively correlated with the respective subjective effort ratings.
b) ...

5. Individual subjective values of ER strategies are related to personality traits:
a) Habitual use of reappraisal measured via ERQ is positively correlated with subjective value of distancing.
b) Habitual use of suppression measured via ERQ is positively correlated with subjective value of suppression.
C) Higher emotion regulation flexibility measured via FlexER is associated with higher subjective values of all strategies.

6. Emotion regulation success is associated with self-control
a) Higher self-control is associated with more down-regulation of emotional arousal during use of ER strategies.

Research Questions for associations between T1 and T2

7. How much does Effort Discounting depend on the stimulus material?
a) The Area under the Curve values for the subjective values of T1 and T2 are highly correlated (i.e. low intra-individual ED-variability)
b) ...

# Research Questions for t1 (COG-ED)

1. Associations of subjective and objective task load measures:
* a) The signal detection measure d’ declines with increasing n-back level.
* b) Reaction time increases with increasing n-back level. 
* c) Ratings on all NTLX subscales increase with increasing n-back level.

2. Associations of task load and effort discounting:
* a) Subjective values decline with increasing n-back level.
* b) Subjective values decline with increasing n-back level, even after controlling for declining task performance measured by signal detection d’ and reaction time.
* c) *New:* SVs decline stronger with increasing task load for individuals with low compared to high NFC scores.

3. Individual differences in effort discounting:
* a) Subjective values predict individual NFC scores.
* b) NTLX scores do not predict individual NFC scores.


# Research Questions for t2 (ER-ED)

4. What are individual subjective values of emotion regulation strategies?
* a) The individual subjective values of ER strategies are negatively correlated with the respective subjective effort ratings.
* b) The individual subjective values of ER strategies are positively correlated with ER success (i.e., arousal ratings and EMG).

5. Which variables can predict individual subjective values of ER strategies?

6. Individual subjective values of ER strategies are related to personality traits:
* a) Habitual use of reappraisal measured via ERQ is positively correlated with subjective value of distancing.
* b) Habitual use of suppression measured via ERQ is positively correlated with subjective value of suppression.
* c) Higher emotion regulation flexibility measured via FlexER is associated with higher subjective values of all strategies.

7. Emotion regulation success is associated with self-control
* a) Modell aus Self-Control (latenter Faktor vorhergesagt durch 4 (?) Fragebögen) und Success (latenter Faktor aus 2 Maßen (subjektiv und objektiver Success))

# Research Questions for associations between T1 and T2

8. How much does Effort Discounting depend on the stimulus material?
* a) The AUC for the subjective values of T1 and T2 are highly correlated (i.e. low intra-individual ED-variability)
* b) Irgendwas mit slopes und intercepts (Reihenfolge der Level darf bei T1 nicht geordnet werden, bei T2 muss es geordnet werden)

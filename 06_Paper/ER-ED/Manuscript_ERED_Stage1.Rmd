abstract          : |
 Individuals have a repertoire of emotion regulation (ER) strategies at their disposal, which they can use more or less flexibly. 
 In ER flexibility research, strategies that facilitate goal achievement are considered adaptive and therefore are subjectively valuable. 
 Individuals are motivated to reduce their emotional arousal effectively and to avoid cognitive effort. 
 Perceived costs of ER strategies in the form of effort, however, are highly subjective. 
 Subjective values (SVs) should therefore represent a trade-off between effectiveness and subjectively required cognitive effort. 
 However, SVs of ER strategies have not been determined so far. 
 We present a paradigm that is suitable for determining individual SVs of ER strategies. 
 Using a multilevel modelling approach, it will be investigated whether individual SVs can be explained by effectiveness (subjective arousal, facial muscle activity) and subjective effort. 
 Relations of SVs to personality traits will be explored

This research is partly funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 940.
Additionally, we have applied for funding of the participants' compensation from centralized funds of the Faculty of Psychology at Technische Universität Dresden.
Applications for the centralized funds will be reviewed in May.
Regardless of whether or not this additional funding will be granted, the study can commence immediately.
The funders have/had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.

*Figure 1.* Exemplary visualization of two response patterns. In the top half, the person has a clear preference for one of the three strategies. In the lower half, they have no clear preference and therefore show an inconsistent response pattern. This pattern can also be represented by our paradigm.

## Detailed information on psychometric measures {#SupplementQuestionnaires}

*WHO-5.*
General psychological well-being is assessed using the WHO-5 scale[@Bech2004; @Braehler2007].
5 Items such as "Over the past 2 weeks I have felt calm and relaxed." are rated on a 6-point Likert scale raning from 0 (at no time) to 5 (all of the time).
The german version of the scale showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's $\alpha=.92$)[@Braehler2007].

*Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale.*
Resilience is assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)[@Connor2003; @Campbell-Sills2007; @Sarubin2015].
10 items such as "I am able to adapt to change." are rated on a scale from 0 (not true at all) to 4 (true nearly all the time).
The 10-item version showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's $\alpha=.84$) and a satisfactory retest-reliability of $r_{tt}=.81$ across 6 month[@Sarubin2015].

*Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.* 
Habitual use of reappraisal and suppression is measured using the 10-item Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)[@GrossJohn2003;@Abler2009].
The scale has items such as "I keep my emotions to myself" (ERQ-suppression - 4 items) and "When I'm faced with a stressful situation, I make myself think about it in a way that helps me stay calm" (ERQ-reappraisal - 6 items), which are answered on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), and has acceptable to high internal consistency (Cronbach’s $\alpha>.75$) [@Preece2020].

*FlexER Scale.*
Flexible use of ER strategies is assessed using the FlexER Scale [@Doerfel2019] with items such as "If I want to feel less negative emotions, I have several strategies to achieve this.", which are answered on a 4-point scale ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree".
Psychometric properties are currently under investigation.

*Implicit Theories Questionnaire.*
Implicit theories of willpower in emotional control are assessed using the Implicit Theories Questionnaire of @Bernecker2017.
4 items such as "Having to control a strong emotion makes you exhausted and you are less able to manage your feelings right afterwards." are rated on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (fully agree) to 6 (do not agree at all).
The questionnaire showed an internal consistency of Cronbach's $\alpha=.87$[@Bernecker2017].

*Need for Cognition Scale.*
Need for Cognition (NFC) is assessed with the 16-item short version of the German NFC scale [@Bless1994]. 
Responses to each item (e.g., "Thinking is not my idea of fun", recoded) are recorded on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from -3 (completely disagree) to +3 (completely agree) and are summed to the total NFC score. 
The scale shows comparably high internal consistency (Cronbach's $\alpha>.80$)[@Bless1994; @Fleischhauer2010] and a retest reliability of $r_{tt}=.83$ across 8 to 18 weeks [@Fleischhauer2015].

*Self-Regulation Scale.*
As one measure of self-control, the Self-Regulation Scale (SRS)[@Schwarzer1999] is used.
The scale has 10 items (e.g., "It is difficult for me to suppress thoughts that interfere with what I need to do.", recoded) on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 4 (exactly true).
It has high internal consistency [Cronbach's $\alpha>.80$; @Schwarzer1999].

*Brief Self-Control Scale.* 
As a second measure of self-control, the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS)[@Tangney2004; @Sproesser2011] is used. 
It comprises 13 items (e.g., “I am good at resisting temptations”) with a 5-point rating scale ranging from 1 (not at all like me) to 5 (very much like me). 
The scale shows acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s $\alpha=.81$)[@Sproesser2011] .

*Barratt Impulsiveness Scale.*
As a third measure of self-control, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)[@Patton1995; @Hartmann2011] is used.
Responses to each item (e.g., "I am self-controlled.", recoded) are assessed on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (never/rarely) to 4 (almost always/always).
An internal consistency of Cronbach's $\alpha=.74$ and a retest reliability of $r_{tt}=.56$ for General Impulsiveness and $r_{tt}=.66$ for Total Score across 6 month were reported [@Hartmann2011].

*Attentional Control Scale.*
Attentional control is measured using the Attentional Control Scale (ACS)[@Derryberry2002] with items such as "My concentration is good even if there is music in the room around me".
The 20 items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (always).
An internal consistency of Cronbach's $\alpha=.88$ was reported [@Derryberry2002].

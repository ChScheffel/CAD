# 3. Results

## 3.1 Participants and descriptive statistics

Data collection took place between `r format(as.Date(acqui_time[1]), "%Y-%m")` and `r format(as.Date(acqui_time[2]), "%Y-%m")`. A total of $N=`r sum(data_survey$lay_beliefs_complete == 2)`$ participants completed the online survey and were invited to participate in the two lab sessions. Of these, $N=`r sum(data_survey$files_coged_complete == 2)`$ participated in the first laboratory session and $N=`r sum(data_survey$followup_ered_complete == 2)`$ completed the second laboratory session. Of these, $n=1$ person had to be excluded from analyses because they did not follow the instructions.

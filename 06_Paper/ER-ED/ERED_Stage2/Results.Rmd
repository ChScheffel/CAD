# 3. Results

## 3.1 Participants and descriptive statistics

Data collection took place between `r format(as.Date(acqui_time[1]), "%Y-%m")` and `r format(as.Date(acqui_time[2]), "%Y-%m")`.
A total of $N=`r sum(data_survey[,"lay_beliefs_complete"] == 2)`$ participants completed the online survey and were invited to participate in the two lab sessions.
Of these, $N=`r sum(data_survey[,"files_coged_complete"] == 2)`$ participated in the first laboratory session [@ZernaScheffel2022] and $N=`r sum(data_survey[,"followup_ered_complete"] == 2)`$ completed the second laboratory session.
Of these, $n=1$ person had to be excluded from analyses because they did not follow the instructions.
The final sample consisted of $N=`r sum(data_survey[,"followup_ered_complete"] == 2)-1`$ participants (`r length(which(data_descr[which(data_descr[,"ID"] != dplyr::lag(data_descr[,"ID"])),"gender"] == 2))` female; age: $M=`r papaja::printnum(mean(data_descr[,"age"], na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1, gt1 = TRUE)`\text{ }\pm\text{ }SD = `r papaja::printnum(sd(data_descr[,"age"], na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1, gt1 = TRUE)`$).
Please note that sample size for individual calculations may be smaller due to failure of EMG recording ($n=1$) and failure to record utility ratings ($n=`r sum(is.na(data_ER[,"utility"][data_ER[,"block"] == "3_distraction"]))`$).

## 3.2. Confirmatory analyses

### Manipulation checks

#### Subjective arousal and physiological responding

To explore whether negative pictures evoke emotional arousal and physiological responding, we conducted separate ANOVAs for the active viewing condition with predictors subjective arousal, *Corrugator* and *Levator* activity.
Descriptive values of each predictor for each condition can be found in table \@ref(tab:TabDescr).
We found a highly significant main effect of valence for subjective arousal (`r papaja::apa_print(SubjArousalView_aov)$full_result`, `r papaja::apa_print(SubjArousalView_BF)$statistic`), *Corrugator* activity (`r papaja::apa_print(EMGCorrView_aov)$full_result`, `r papaja::apa_print(EMGCorrView_BF)$statistic`), and *Levator* activity (`r papaja::apa_print(EMGLevView_aov)$full_result`, `r papaja::apa_print(EMGLevView_BF)$statistic`), indicating that negative pictures successfully increased emotional arousal and physiological responding.

To investigate whether ER strategies reduce emotional arousal and physiological responding, we conducted separate rmANOVA comparing subjective arousal, *Corrugator* and *Levator* activity of four strategies (active viewing, distraction, distancing, suppression). 
We found a significant effect of strategy for subjective arousal (`r papaja::apa_print(SubjArousalReg_aov)$full_result`, `r papaja::apa_print(SubjArousalReg_BF)$statistic`), *Corrugator* activity (`r papaja::apa_print(EMGCorrReg_aov)$full_result`, `r papaja::apa_print(EMGCorrReg_BF)$statistic`), and *Levator* activity (`r papaja::apa_print(EMGLevReg_aov)$full_result`, `r papaja::apa_print(EMGLevReg_BF)$statistic`), indicating that regulation strategies reduced subjective arousal and physiological responding.
For detailed information on post-hoc tests, please see tables \@ref(tab:SupplEffectArousalReg) to \@ref(tab:SupplEffectLevReg) and figures \@ref(fig:SupplFigArousalReg) to \@ref(fig:SupplFigLevReg) in the [supplementary material](#SupplementEffectER).

```

#### Subjective effort of ER strategies

To investigate whether ER strategies require cognitive effort, we conducted an rmANOVA comparing the subjective effort ratings of four strategies (active viewing, distraction, distancing, suppression).
We found a significant effect of strategy (`r papaja::apa_print(SubjEffort_aov)$full_result`, `r papaja::apa_print(SubjEffort_BF)$statistic`; see figure\ \@ref(fig:FigSubjEffort)).
Post-hoc test showed significantly higher subjective effort for distraction (`r papaja::apa_print(pairs(SubjEffort_emm))$statistic$X2viewneg_X3distraction`, `r papaja::apa_print(BayesFactor::ttestBF(x = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "2_view_neg"], y = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "3_distraction"],progress = FALSE, paired = TRUE))$statistic`), distancing (`r papaja::apa_print(pairs(SubjEffort_emm))$statistic$X2viewneg_X4distancing`, `r papaja::apa_print(BayesFactor::ttestBF(x = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "2_view_neg"], y = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "4_distancing"],progress = FALSE, paired = TRUE))$statistic`), and suppression (`r papaja::apa_print(pairs(SubjEffort_emm))$statistic$X2viewneg_X5suppression`, `r papaja::apa_print(BayesFactor::ttestBF(x = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "2_view_neg"], y = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "5_suppression"],progress = FALSE, paired = TRUE))$statistic`) compared to active viewing. 
Moreover, we found significantly lower effort during suppression compared with distraction (`r papaja::apa_print(pairs(SubjEffort_emm))$statistic$X3distraction_X5suppression`, `r papaja::apa_print(BayesFactor::ttestBF(x = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "3_distraction"], y = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "5_suppression"],progress = FALSE, paired = TRUE))$statistic`) and distancing (`r papaja::apa_print(pairs(SubjEffort_emm))$statistic$X4distancing_X5suppression`, `r papaja::apa_print(BayesFactor::ttestBF(x = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "4_distancing"], y = Ratings_reg$effort[Ratings_reg$block == "5_suppression"],progress = FALSE, paired = TRUE))$statistic`).

knitr::include_graphics(here("06_Paper", "ER-ED", "ERED_Stage2", "figures", "FigSubjEffort.png"))
```

The cognitive effort expended also played the most important role in the subsequent choice decision, which resembled previous findings of our group[@Scheffel2021]. 
Here, `r round((54/119)*100, digits = 1)`% stated that they chose the strategy that was easiest for them to implement.
`r round((29/119)*100, digits = 1)`% stated they chose the strategy that was most effective and `r round((14/119)*100, digits = 1)`% stated their chosen strategy was the easiest and most effective.
A more detailed list of all reasons can be found in Table XX in [supplementary material](#SupplementReasonChoice).

#### Subjective values of ER strategies

Individual SVs could be determined for `r nrow(data_SV)/3` participants for all three ER strategies.
SVs ranged between `r papaja::apa_num(min(data_SV$sv), digits = 3)` and `r papaja::apa_num(max(data_SV$sv))`.
In sum, $n=$ `r  papaja::printnum(sum(data_SV$sv == 1))` had one SV of 1.0, indicating a clear preference for one ER strategy.
Absolute preferences for ER strategies were relatively equally distributed.
Highest SV for distraction was reported by $n=$ `r  papaja::printnum(sum(data_SV$strat_c[data_SV$strategy == "distraction"] == -1))`, for distancing by $n=$ `r  papaja::printnum(sum(data_SV$strat_c[data_SV$strategy == "distancing"] == -1))`, and for suppression by $n=$ `r papaja::printnum(sum(data_SV$strat_c[data_SV$strategy == "suppression"] == -1))`.

To investigate, which variables can predict individual SVs of ER strategies, a multilevel model approach was chosen.
The ICC of the null model was $ICC=$ `r papaja::printnum(ICC_between_MLM_0)`, indicating that the level-2 predictor subject accounted for `r papaja::printnum(round(ICC_between_MLM_0*100, digits = 1))`% of total variance.
The preregistered model showed a correlation of $r=$ `r papaja::printnum(attr(summary(MLM_1)$varcor[1]$ID,"correlation")[1,2])` of the random effects subjects and recoded strategy ($BF10$ of the variable strategy: `r papaja::apa_print(MLM_1_BF)$statistic`).
Our model explained `r papaja::printnum(MLM1_r2[2])`% of variance and thus we assumed our model was overfitted due to including recoded strategy as the random slope.
We therefore set a new model without the recoded strategy as the random slope factor to estimate the influence of predictors on SVs more precisely.
The second model followed the specification: 
$$
\begin{split}
SV \sim \text{effort rating} + \text{arousal rating} + \text{utility rating} + corrugator \text{ activity} \\\ + levator \text{ activity} + (1 |subject)
\end{split}
$$ 

The second model explained `r papaja::printnum(MLM2_r2[2])`% of variance. 
All results of the second model are in Table\ \@ref(tab:TabMLMH5).

[INSERT TABLE 2 HERE]

``` {r TabMLMH5, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
papaja::apa_table(
  H5_M2_table,
  caption = "Results of multilevel model predicting subjective values of ER strategies.",
  booktabs = TRUE,
  escape = FALSE,
  placement = "H")
```

The predictors effort rating (`r papaja::apa_print(MLM_2)$full_result$effort_cwc`), utility rating (`r papaja::apa_print(MLM_2)$full_result$utility_cwc`), and *Corrugator* activity (`r papaja::apa_print(MLM_2)$full_result$Corr_cwc`) showed a significant association with SVs.
The values were relatively small, so the respective effect size $f^{2}$ was calculated as the explained variance.
The predictor utility rating showed the greatest effect size of all predictors ($f^{2}=$ `r papaja::printnum(H5_M2_table[4,5], digits = 3)`), indicating that utility rating explained `r papaja::printnum(H5_M2_table[4,5]*100, digits = 1)`% of variance in SVs.
Effort rating showed an effect size of $f^{2}=$ `r papaja::printnum(H5_M2_table[2,5], digits = 3)`.
The effect sizes of all other predictors were negligibly small ($f^{2}< 0.01$).

#### Associations between subjective values and flexible ER

To investigate the ecological validity of the subjective values of ER strategies we calculated, we tested whether SVs were associated with the actual choice of participants in the choice block.
Therefore, a $\chi^{2}$ test with predicted choice (i.e., the strategy with the highest SV of each participant) and actual choice was computed.
There was a significant association between predicted choice and actual choice (`r papaja::apa_print(choice_chisq, n=119)$statistic[[1]]`, `r papaja::apa_print(choice_chisq_BF)$statistic`; see figure\ \@ref(fig:FigSVChoice)). <!--JZ: Vielleicht wäre hier eine Heatmap auch ganz nice, das scheint wohl eine gute Visualisierung für einen Chi Square Test zu sein (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/decoding-the-chi-square-test%E2%80%8A-%E2%80%8Ause-along-with-implementation-and-visualization/)-->

[INSERT FIGURE 4 HERE]

```{r FigSVChoice, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Individual subjective values per ER strategy, grouped by choice in last experimental block. Each dot indicates SV of one particpant, the colours indicate their choice in last experimental block. $N=120$", fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("06_Paper", "ER-ED", "ERED_Stage2", "figures", "FigSVChoice.png"))
```

We then conducted an ordinal regression with the dependent variable "choice" and the individual SVs of all three strategies as independent variables.
Overall model fit was fair with $R^{2}=$ `r papaja::printnum(Choice_OrdReg_R2)`.
The predictor SV of strategy distraction was found to contribute to the model (`r papaja::apa_print(Choice_OrdReg)$full_result$distraction_sv`, $BF10=$ `r papaja::printnum(Choice_OrdReg_Posterior$BFtu_exploratory[2,2])`).
The estimated odds ratio indicated a higher chance of choosing strategy distraction, when SV of that strategy is higher.
Additionally, the predictor SV of strategy suppression was found to contribute to the model (`r papaja::apa_print(Choice_OrdReg)$full_result$suppression_sv`, $BF10=$ `r papaja::printnum(Choice_OrdReg_Posterior$BFtu_exploratory[4,3])`).
The estimated odds ration indicated that a participant is more likely to later choose suppression, when SV of strategy suppression is higher.

Last, we investigated whether SVs are associated with ER flexibility.
We conducted a logistic regression to inspect whether participants' individual $slopes$ and $intercepts$ of ordered SVs could predict their ER flexibility score.
We found neither a significant association between $slopes$ of SVs and FlexER score (`r papaja::apa_print(Flex_LM)$full_result$slope`, `r papaja::apa_print(Flex_LM_BF)$full_result$slope`), nor between $intercepts$ and FlexER score (`r papaja::apa_print(Flex_LM)$full_result$intercept`, `r papaja::apa_print(Flex_LM_BF)$full_result$intercept`).
However, model fit was relatively low (`r papaja::apa_print(Flex_LM)$full_result$modelfit$r2`).

## 3.3. Exploratory analyses

We exploratorily wanted to investigate the influence of self-control and the investment trait Need for Cognition (NFC) on individual SVs of ER strategies.
The starting point for this was the model reported before. 
Only predictors that had previously shown a significant association with SVs were included in the model together with level-2 predictors self-control and NFC.
The third model followed the specification:
$$
\begin{split}
SV \sim \text{effort rating} + \text{utility rating} + corrugator \text{ activity} \\\ \text{self-control} + \text{NFC} + (1 |subject)
\end{split}
$$
As one would expect, the predictors effort rating (`r papaja::apa_print(MLM_3)$full_result$effort_cwc`) showed a negative association with SVs, while utility rating (`r papaja::apa_print(MLM_3)$full_result$utility_cwc`), and *Corrugator* activity (`r papaja::apa_print(MLM_3)$full_result$Corr_cwc`) showed a significant positive association with SVs.
In addition, a positive association was also found between self-control and SVs (`r papaja::apa_print(MLM_3)$full_result$SC_gmc`).
However, the effect size of self-control was negligibly small ($f^{2}=$ `r papaja::printnum(Exp_M3_table[5,5], digits = 3)`).

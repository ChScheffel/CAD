# Discussion

The present Registered Report sought to evaluate whether our new Cognitive and Affective Discounting (CAD) paradigm is suitable for determining individual subjective values of emotion regulation strategies.
We therefore adapted the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm by Westbrook et al. [@Westbrook2013] in a way that it is now possible to determine SVs for tasks that have no objective order of difficulty levels. 
The new paradigm was tested on an *n*-back task [@ZernaScheffel2022] and a classic ER paradigm with the strategies distraction, distancing, and suppression.
The latter was completed by $N=`r sum(data_survey[,"followup_ered_complete"] == 2)`$ participants.

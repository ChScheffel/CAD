# Discussion

The present Registered Report sought to evaluate whether our new Cognitive and Affective Discounting (CAD) paradigm is suitable for determining individual subjective values of the ER strategies strategies distraction, distancing, and suppression.
We therefore adapted the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm by Westbrook et al. [-@Westbrook2013] in a way that it is now possible to determine SVs for tasks that have no objective order of difficulty levels. 
The new paradigm was tested on an *n*-back task [@ZernaScheffel2022] and a classic ER paradigm.
The latter was completed by $N=`r sum(data_survey[,"followup_ered_complete"] == 2)`$ participants. 
As expected, use of ER strategies was associated with decreased subjective and physiological arousal.
This finding is in line with previous meta-analytic findings, indicating the effectiveness of ER strategies, both on subjective as well as physiological levels [@Webb2012;@Zaehringer2020].
Further, we found higher levels of subjective cognitive effort for all ER strategies compared to active viewing. 
This allows us to replicate previous findings from our research group and show that the use of strategies is associated with cognitive effort [@Scheffel2021].
Both measures also showed great variability between individuals.
Taken together, this means that the ER strategies had an effect on the participants as intended: Individuals were able to reduce subjective and physiological responding effectively at the expense of cognitive effort.
We assume that there was a good basis on which individual SVs of ER strategies could be determined.
All in all, our hypotheses H1 to H5 were confirmed.

Almost all participants showed an absolute preference for one strategy, indicated by a SV of 1. 
We also found a wide range of SVs (between `r papaja::apa_num(min(data_SV$sv), digits = 3)` and `r papaja::apa_num(max(data_SV$sv))`), suggesting that individuals prefer strategies to different extents.
There was a significant relationship between SVs and choice of strategy. 
Overly frequent the strategy would be chosen by the persons for whom the highest subjective value had been determined before, which confirms our hypothesis H7.
Further, we found associations between individual SVs and different predictors.
Subjective effort, utility, and *Corrugator* muscle activity significantly predicted individual SVs.
Contrary to our hypothesis H6, utility was the best predictor for individual SVs, explaining `r papaja::printnum(H5_M2_table[4,5]*100, digits = 1)` percent of variance in SVs.
However, individual SVs did not show associations with ER flexibility, we therefore found no evidence for hypothesis H7.

## Ecological validity of subjective values of ER strategies

Our goal was to calculate individual subjective values to develop a better understanding of ER stratagem selection.
Most individuals show great variability in the choice of strategies, both, within-strategy and between-strategy[@Blanke2020;@Burr2020;@Elkjaer2022]. 
Greater variability might even adaptive [@Blanke2020;@Aldao2015].
In addition, a wide variety of factors that influence the choice of stratgies in specific situations were examined[@Scheffel2021;@Sheppes2011;@Sheppes2014;@Wilms2020;@Young2020].
Thus, different factors have only rarely been studied together[@Young2020].
Moreover, the usual paradigms used in ER choice research (e.g., Sheppes et al.[@Sheppes2011]) cannot be used to determine what internal subjective value the subjects associated with the strategies.
However, we succeeded in this with our new CAD paradigm.
On the one hand, we were able to show which factors influence the values, but on the other hand, we were able to show the actual practical relevance of the values.
The highest SVs of the individuals were associated with the choice made by the participants. 
Until now, it has been difficult to transfer such findings from the laboratory to everyday life[@Wilms2020].
This could be due to the fact that the strategies that have to be chosen between are often fixed in laboratory tests by the experimental design[@Sheppes2011;@Sheppes2014;@Scheffel2021].
It was therefore attempted to investigate ER choice and influencing factors in everyday life.
However, even there, certain strategies were often prescribed (for example studies, see English et al.[@Englisch2017], Millgram et al.[@Millgram2019], Wilms et al.[@Wilms2020]). 
Although these covered a large area of the emotion-genesis process[@Gross1998emerging], they were nevertheless ultimately fixed.
Of course, the calculation of SVs in our new CAD paradigm is tied to the strategies with which the strategy of interest is compared.
However, it would be possible to use ecological momentary assessment to capture ER strategies[@Koval2020].
This would allow all strategies of the ER repertoire to be recorded for each individual[@Aldao2015]. 
Also those that are rarely used or even marked as maladaptive, such as alcohol consumption or rumination[@Pena-Sarrionandia2015].

## Limitations

Our findings must be considered in light of several limitations.
First, it must be mentioned that a block design was used.
This allows for habituation effects of EMG activity within the block.
However, block designs are common in ER research [@Barreiros2019] and were used in previous studies [@Scheffel2019]. 
Second, it has to be mentioned that subjective arousal, effort, and utility ratings were conducted retrospectively at the end of each block.
It is also known that affect labeling might attenuate emotional experience [@Liebermann2007;@Torre2018]. 
That is why we decided not to have the ratings done after every image.
Furthermore, we were able to confirm our manipulation checks, indicating that implementation of ER strategies was successful, both on subjective and physiological levels.
Taken together, these two facts may have led to slightly lower associations between SVs and predictors.

Third, it is a major limitation that participants had to use three given ER strategies.
It could be that some of the participants did not implement or were used to any of the three strategies in everyday life.
So it may be that none of the strategies has a really high subjective value for the person.
However, strategies for attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation were chosen that meta-analytically proved to be most effective [@Webb2012]. 
Related to that, individual SVs of each person have to be interpreted with caution. 
They depend on the specific context: The stimulus material presented and the strategies that are compared with each other.
Thus, it could be that SVs for one ER strategy would be higher or lower when using other stimuli or valences of stimuli and other comparison strategies.
That is because the computation of SVs is inseparable form the other SVs.

Fourth, the highest value during the discounting paradigm was set to 2 € as fixed value.
Participants should imagine that this was the amount of money they would get when they would repeat this strategy.
Thus, 2 € as an incentive to repeat an entire regulation block could be quite low.
However, we chose this amount because, first, we have followed the original paradigm of Westbrook[@Westbrook2013].
Further it was shown that at least in cognitive effort discounting, a lower incentive could even increase sensitivity in participants for differences in effort[@Bialaszek2017].
n the future, however, it should be examined how the level of incentives affects subjective values.

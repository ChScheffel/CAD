# 1. Introduction

[...]
Individual subjective values (SV) of cognitive effort have been quantified using the cognitive effort discounting paradigm (COG-ED) [@Westbrook2013]. 

## 1.1 Adapting an effort discounting paradigm

In the original study by Westbrook et al. [-@Westbrook2013], cognitive load was varied using the *N*-back task. 
Participants had to decide whether repeating a higher *N*-back level for larger, fixed monetary reward, or a lower level for a smaller, varying reward. 
In the current study, we want to use this paradigm to determine SVs of ER strategies.
In doing so, we need to make an important change: we have to adapt the assumption that the easiest *N*-back level has the highest SV.
As we have shown in previous studies, there are large inter-individual differences in the preference and perceived subjective effort of ER strategies [@Scheffel2021].

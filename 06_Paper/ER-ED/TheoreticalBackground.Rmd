# 1. Introduction

The ability to modify emotional experiences, expressions, and physiological reactions [@Gross1998antecedent] to regulate emotions is an important cognitive skill. 
It is therefore not surprising that emotion regulation (ER) has substantial implications for well-being and adaptive functioning[@Gross1998emerging].
Different strategies can be used to regulate emotions, namely situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modification[@Gross1998antecedent], and, following the taxonomy of Powers and LaBar[-@Powers2019], individuals can implement ER strategies by means of different tactics.
So called antecedent-focused strategies, e.g., attentional deployment and cognitive change, take effect early in the emotion generation process[@Gross1998antecedent].
In contrast, response modification takes place late in the process and is therefore conceptualized as a response-focused strategy[@Gross1998antecedent].
This postulated temporal sequence of ER strategies influences their effectiveness.
Albeit it is meta-analytically proven that all mentioned strategies reduce subjective emotional experience, distraction as a tactic of attentional deployment and (expressive) suppression as a tactic of response modulation showed only small to medium effect sizes (distraction: _d~+~_ = 0.27; suppression: _d~+~_ = 0.27).
In contrast, distancing as tactic of cognitive change showed the highest effectiveness with an effect size of _d~+~_ = 0.45[@Webb2012].

Psychophysiological measures provide further important information on the effectiveness of emotion regulation strategies (for an overview, see Zaehringer et al.[@Zaehringer2020]).
Compared to cardiovascular, electrodermal, and pupillometric autonomic responses, facial electromyography has been reported consistently across studies to be influenced by emotion regulation with even medium effect sizes.
For example, studies have shown that reappraisal of negative emotion is associated with reduced activity of the corrugator supercilii (associated with anger, sadness, and fear) with _d~-~_ = 0.32[@Zaehringer2020].
In addition, the levator labii superioris (associated with disgust) has also been associated with reduced activity during reappraisal[@Burr2021]. 
Similar effects have been reported for suppression[@Burr2021], distancing[@Gaertner2021], and distraction[@Schoenfelder2014].
Importantly, results on electromyographic measures  seem to be more consistent compared to other autonomic measures, likely because they are specific to emotional valence and its changes.

Similarly to the differences in short term effectiveness, these tactics from three different strategies are also related to different medium and long-term consequences. 
In particular, strategies that do not change the emotional content of the situation, for instance by taking a neutral perspective (i.e., distraction and suppression) are presumed to be disadvantageous in the longer term.
Thus, the self-reported habitual use of suppression is associated with more negative affect and lower general well-being[@GrossJohn2003]. 
In addition, a number of ER strategies, e.g., rumination and suppression, have been associated with mental disorders (for meta-analytic review, see Aldao et al.[@Aldao2010]), which led to the postulation of *adaptive* (such as reappraisal, acceptance) and *maladaptive* (such as suppression, rumination) ER strategies.
For example, it was shown that maladaptive ER strategies (rumination and suppression) mediate the effect between neuroticism and depressive symptoms[@Yoon2013].

The postulation of *adaptive* and *maladaptive* ER strategies has been challenged by the concepts of ER repertoire and ER flexibility.
Within this framework, *maladaptive*  refers to inflexible ER strategy use or use of strategies that are hindering goal achievement[@Aldao2015].
Adaptive flexible ER requires a large repertoire of ER strategies[@Aldao2015].
The term “repertoire” can be defined as the ability to utilize a wide range of regulatory strategies in divergent contextual demands and opportunities[@Bonanno2013].
A growing number of studies report findings about the repertoire of emotion regulation strategies and its relationship to psychopathology[@DixonGordon2015;@Lougheed2012;@Southward2018]. 
Additionally, greater ER flexibility is related to reduced negative affect and therefore beneficial in daily life[@Blanke2020].

How do people choose strategies from their repertoire? 
Similarly to the expectancy-value model of emotion regulation[@Tamir2015] it could be assumed, that people also assign a value to an ER strategy reflecting the usefulness of this strategy for goal achieving.
Evidence from other psychological domains (e.g., intertemporal choice[@Kable2007]) shows that subjective values (SVs) are attributed to the choice options on the basis of which the decision is made. 
Research on ER choice has identified numerous factors that influence the choice of ER strategies, which can be seen as indirect evidence for factors influencing SVs[@Sheppes2014]. 
For example, a study found that the intensity of a stimulus or situation plays a role in the choice[@Sheppes2011]. 
Higher intensity of the (negative) stimulus lead to a choice of rather disengaging tactics of attentional deployment, like distraction[@Sheppes2011;@Sheppes2014].
ER choice was further influenced by, among others, extrinsic motivation (e.g., monetary incentives), motivational determinants (i.e., hedonic regulatory goals), and effort[@Sheppes2014;@Scheffel2021].
With regard to effort, we could show in our previous work that the choice for an ER strategy is mainly influenced by the effort required to implement a given strategy[@Scheffel2021].
In our study, participants used the strategies distancing and suppression while inspecting emotional pictures.
Afterwards, they choose which strategy they wanted to use again.
Participants tended to re-apply the strategy that was subjectively less effortful, even though it was subjectively not the most effective one - in this case: suppression.
Interestingly, the choice was independent of self-reported habitual use of suppression and reappraisal.
Nonetheless, there are only few studies to date that examined the required effort of several strategies in more detail and compared them with each other.
Furthermore, the research on ER choice lacks information regarding the strategies that were *not* chosen in each case.
It is unclear whether people had clear preferences or whether the choice options were similarly attractive.

We assume that people choose the strategy that has the highest value for them at the moment.
The value is determined against the background of goal achievement in the specific situation: A strategy is highly valued if it facilitates goal achievement[@Aldao2015]. 
One certainly central goal is the regulation of negative affect.
A second, intrinsic and less obvious goal is the avoidance of effort[@Inzlicht2018].
When given the choice, most individuals prefer tasks that are less effortful[@Hull1943] and chose strategies that were less effortful[@Scheffel2021].
We assume that both aspects are traded off against each other by individuals to determine individual subjective values (SVs) of ER strategies: A strategy is more valuable if it can reduce emotional arousal *and* is less effortful.
In addition, perceived utility should have an impact on SVs. 
A strategy that is less effortful and can objectively regulate arousal (i.e., is effective), but is not subjectively perceived as useful, should have a low SV.
Moreover, SVs of ER Strategies could therefore be helpful to describe the ER repertoire[@Aldao2015] more comprehensively.
Depending on the flexibility of a person, different patterns of SVs could be conceivable: A person with high flexibility would show relatively high SVs for a number of strategies.
This would mean that all strategies are a good option for goal achievement.
A second person with less flexibility, however, would show high SVs only for only one strategy or low SVs for all of the strategies.
This in turn would mean that there is only a limited amount of strategies in the repertoire to choose from. 
Subsequently, the ability to choose an appropriate strategy for a specific situation is also limited.

So far we have not seen any attempt in ER choice research to determine individual SVs of ER strategies.
However, this would be useful to describe interindividual differences in the preference of ER strategies and the ER repertoire more comprehensively.
To investigate this question, the individual SVs of each strategy available for selection would have to be determined.
Promising approaches can be found in studies on difficulty levels of effortful cognitive tasks.  
Individual SVs of effortful cognitive tasks have been quantified using the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm (COG-ED)[@Westbrook2013]. 

In the original study by Westbrook et al.[-@Westbrook2013], cognitive load was varied using the *n*-back task, a working memory task that requires fast and accurate responses to sequentially presented stimuli. 
Participants had to decide in an iterative procedure whether they wanted to repeat a higher *n*-back level for a larger, fixed monetary reward, or a lower level for a smaller, varying reward, with the implicit assumption that the objectively easiest *n*-back level has the highest SV.
In the present study, we want to use this paradigm to determine SVs of ER strategies.
In doing so, we need to make an important change: We have to adapt the assumption that the easiest *n*-back level has the highest SV.
As we have shown in previous studies, there are large inter-individual differences in the preference and perceived subjective effort of ER strategies[@Scheffel2021].
Moreover, there is nothing like an objectively easiest ER strategy.
Therefore, we have to add an additional step, which precedes the other steps and where the ER option with the higher subjective value is determined. 
In this step, the same monetary value (i.e., 1 €) is assigned to both options.
The assumption is that participants now choose the option that has the higher SV for them.
In the next step we return to the original paradigm.
The higher monetary value (i.e., 2 €) is assigned to the option that was not chosen in the first step and therefore is assumed to have the lower SV.
In the following steps, the lower value is changed in every iteration according to Westbrook et al.[-@Westbrook2013] until the indifference point is reached.
This procedure will be repeated until all strategies have been compared.
The SV of each strategy is calculated as the mean of this strategy's SV from all comparisons.
In case a participant has a clear preference for one strategy, the SV of this strategy will be 1.
But our paradigm can also account for the case that a person does not have a clear preference.
Then no SV will be 1, but still, the SVs of all strategies can be interpreted as absolute values and in relation to the other strategy's SVs (see Figure \@ref(fig:ResponsePatterns)).
In a separate study, we will test our adapted paradigm together with a *n*-back task and explore whether this paradigm can describe individuals that do not prefer the easiest *n*-back option (see Zerna et al.[@Zerna2022]).

```{r ResponsePatterns, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Exemplary visualization of two response patterns. In the top half, the person has a clear preference for one of the three strategies. In the lower half, they have no clear preference and therefore show an inconsistent response pattern. This pattern can be represented by our paradigm."}
include_graphics(here("06_Paper", "ER-ED", "figures", "Paradigm_Scheme_T2.png" ))
```

The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether this paradigm is suitable for determining SVs of ER strategies. 
As a manipulation check, we first want to investigate whether the valence of the pictures is affecting subjective and physiological responding, resulting in lower subjective arousal ratings after and lower EMG activity during neutral compared to negative pictures.
Second, we want to check whether the ER strategies distraction, distancing, and suppression effectively reduce subjective arousal and physiological responding compared to the active viewing condition.
Third, we want to see whether the strategies subjectively require more cognitive effort than the active viewing condition, and whether participants re-apply the for them least effortful strategy. 
Furthermore, we want to investigate whether subjective effort, arousal ratings, subjective utility, and EMG activity predict individual subjective values of ER strategies.
And lastly, we want to check whether the SV of a strategy is associated with its likelihood of being chosen again, and whether SVs reflect participants' self-reported ER flexibility.
All hypotheses are detailed in the [design table](#DesignTable).
Exploratorily, we want to investigate whether individual SVs are related to personality traits and how individual SVs of ER strategies relate to SVs of other tasks with different demand levels, namely *n*-back.

  abstract   = {The results of a multi-year research program to identify the factors associated with variations in subjective workload within and between different types of tasks are reviewed. Subjective evaluations of 10 workload-related factors were obtained from 16 different experiments. The experimental tasks included simple cognitive and manual control tasks, complex laboratory and supervisory control tasks, and aircraft simulation. Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload.},

  abstract     = {The ability to make inferences about the current state of a dynamic process requires ongoing assessments of the stability and reliability of data generated by that process. We found that these assessments, as defined by a normative model, were reflected in nonluminance-mediated changes in pupil diameter of human subjects performing a predictive-inference task. Brief changes in pupil diameter reflected assessed instabilities in a process that generated noisy data. Baseline pupil diameter reflected the reliability with which recent data indicate the current state of the data-generating process and individual differences in expectations about the rate of instabilities. Together these pupil metrics predicted the influence of new data on subsequent inferences. Moreover, a task- and luminance-independent manipulation of pupil diameter predictably altered the influence of new data. Thus, pupil-linked arousal systems can help to regulate the influence of incoming data on existing beliefs in a dynamic environment.},

Cognitive function was measured at 2 time points with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. We used structural equation modeling to examine a longitudinal mediation model controlling for age, education, years since retirement, and prior occupation.Results.Need for cognition was positively associated with change in cognitive status 2 years later. Variety of cognitive activities was positively associated with level of cognitive status 1 year later. Depressive symptomatology was negatively associated with level of cognitive status 1 year later.Discussion.Our findings indicate that motivational disposition plays a significant role in enhancing cognitive status in retirees, as do variety of cognitive activities. Additionally, subclinical depressive symptomatology can negatively influence cognitive status in young–old retirees. These results have implications for the design of interventions aimed at maintaining the cognitive health of retirees.},

Structural equation modeling was used to identify significant pathways between exogenous variables of conscientiousness, openness, and education to need for cognition, and between neuroticism and health to perceived control. Need for cognition and perceived control emerged as separate and distinct forms of motivation, contributing to positive and negative affect in this model through differing patterns and to different degrees. Mediators between need for cognition and positive affect were frequency of cognitive activity and problem-focus coping. Perceived control had direct effects on positive and negative affect and indirect effects through cognitive activity on positive affect. The model helps to explain some of the psychological mechanisms instrumental in successful adaptation to change in adulthood. The dispositional motivation of need for cognition is described as a character strength with unique predictive value for older adults.},

Zero-order correlations revealed relationships between religiosity and life satisfaction, as well as religious doubt and life satisfaction. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that the three-way interaction of religiosity, religious doubt, and the need for cognition was predictive of life satisfaction. Significant two-way interactions also emerged for both gender and religiosity, and gender and religious doubt as predictors of life satisfaction. Based upon these findings, counseling applications are discussed, and the importance of probing for interactions in research on religious influences on well-being is espoused.},

  abstract = {Need for Cognition (NFC) is conceptualized as an individuals’ tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activity and, thus, captures one’s cognitive engagement. It plays a well-established role in information processing in experimental or academic contexts. However, so far comparably little is known about its consequences for other than purely cognitive or academic outcomes. Indeed, NFC is positively associated with personality traits pertaining to Positive Emotionality (PE) and negatively to traits related to Negative Emotionality (NE). Moreover, evidence suggests NFC to be related to an active, problem-focused coping style. We therefore hypothesized NFC to mediate between life events and individual differences in PE and NE. In a sample of N = 202 volunteers from the general population, we observed that the number of past positive and negative life events had direct effects on PE, and NE, respectively, and that for positive life events, a mediating effect on PE via NFC was observed, with a higher number of past positive life events being related to higher NFC that in turn was related to increased PE. Thus, the present results lend support to the notion of NFC as an important factor supporting personal well-being by way of its mediating role between the number of past positive life events and positive affect.},

Not only can the same outcomes be more rewarding if we apply more (not less) effort, sometimes we select options precisely because they require effort.

The present study aimed to further investigate this distinction by investigating the associations between the two types of MW and two dispositional sub-types of self-consciousness, namely, self-rumination and self-reflection. Specifically, we specified a structural equation model in order to test the hypotheses that (1) self-rumination predicts spontaneous mind-wandering over and above neuroticism, and (2) self-reflection predicts deliberate mind-wandering over and above need for cognition (i.e., the tendency for an individual to engage in and enjoy thinking). Data were collected on 252 online participants. We found that while the spontaneous and deliberate MW were positively associated with each other, spontaneous MW was uniquely positively predicted by self-rumination, over and above neuroticism, whereas deliberate MW was uniquely positively predicted by self-reflection, over and above need for cognition. These results provide further support for the distinction between the two types of MW and suggest specific motivational dispositions for doing spontaneous and deliberate MW.},

  abstract = {Both, the MPQ Control (vs. Impulsivity) scale and the Need for Cognition (NFC) scale, refer to trait concepts encompassing reflective, goal-directed and controlled behavioral tendencies, with the former addressing more behavioral and the latter more cognitive aspects of control. However, research on their relationship with behavioral inhibition, especially with regard to electrophysiological aspects of inhibitory control is scarce. Therefore, in the present study, the trait scores of N=131 participants were analyzed with data from a Go/No-Go task and corresponding electrocortical measures of inhibition, the NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3. Higher MPQ Control scores were associated with fewer false alarms, prolonged reaction times, and a delayed NoGo-N2. This suggests that MPQ Control is related to response inhibition and earlier stages of inhibition processing. There was no association between NFC and behavior, but higher scores were significantly associated with NoGo-N2 and even more strongly with NoGo-P3 latency. This suggests that NFC plays a role particularly in later stages of inhibition-related processing, but does not moderate the suppression of inappropriate and relatively automatic response tendencies in a basic response inhibition task. Future research should employ more complex tasks (e.g., impulsive choice/delay discounting tasks) to further clarify the relation of NFC to behavioral inhibition.},

As we expected, the results of a cross-sectional questionnaire study with 152 undergraduate participants indicated a negative indirect association between NfC and self-rumination through the mediation of EC. Secondarily, the present results revealed a direct positive association between NfC and adaptive type of self-focusing, which is called self-reflection.

Here we investigated potential Dunning–Kruger effects in high-level reasoning and, in particular, focused on the relative effectiveness of metacognitive monitoring among particularly biased reasoners. Participants who made the greatest numbers of errors on the cognitive reflection test (CRT) overestimated their performance on this test by a factor of more than 3. Overestimation decreased as CRT performance increased, and those who scored particularly high underestimated their performance. Evidence for this type of systematic miscalibration was also found on a self-report measure of analytic-thinking disposition. Namely, genuinely nonanalytic participants (on the basis of CRT performance) overreported their “need for cognition” (NC), indicating that they were dispositionally analytic when their objective performance indicated otherwise. Furthermore, estimated CRT performance was just as strong a predictor of NC as was actual CRT performance. Our results provide evidence for Dunning–Kruger effects both in estimated performance on the CRT and in self-reported analytic-thinking disposition. These findings indicate that part of the reason why people are biased is that they are either unaware of or indifferent to their own bias.},

Data from 5,004 participants aged between 18 and 99 years were used to examine both internal relations and external relations of NC. Internal relations were investigated with measures of reliability, examination of factor invariance, and test-retest coefficients across three age groups. External relations were investigated by examining relations of NC with cognitive abilities, engagement, personality, self-rated cognition, and affect. Results suggest that NC may be a broad construct that could reflect motivation to seek out intellectual challenge. In addition, examination of both internal and external relations of NC indicated that the meaning of the construct may be the same across the life span. Finally, the current article showed that the strongest predictor of NC was Openness to Experience, at any age.},

  abstract = {In social interactions, we often need to quickly infer why other people do what they do. More often than not, we infer that behavior is a result of personality rather than circumstances. It is unclear how the tendency itself may contribute to psychopathology and interpersonal dysfunction. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by severe interpersonal dysfunction. Here, we investigated if this dysfunction is related to the tendency to over-attribute behaviors to personality traits. Healthy controls and patients with BPD judged positive and negative behaviors presented within a situational constraint during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Before the experiment, we measured trait levels of empathy, paranoia, and need for cognition. Behaviorally, we found that empathy levels predicted the tendency to attribute behavior to traits in healthy controls, whereas in patients with BPD this relationship was significantly weakened. Whole brain analysis of group-by-empathy interaction revealed that when participants judged the behavior during the attribution phase, several brain regions implicated in mentalizing distinguished patients from controls: In healthy controls, neural activity scaled negatively with empathy, but this relationship was reversed in BPD patients. Due to the cross-sectional study design we cannot establish a causal link between empathy and social attributions. These findings indicate that the self-reported tendency to feel for others is related to the tendency to integrate situational information beyond personality. In BPD patients, by contrast, the association between empathy and attribution was significantly weaker, rendering empathy less informative in predicting the overall attribution style.},

Mentally contrasting a desired future with reality is a self-regulation strategy helping people manage their life by promoting selective goal pursuit: people pursue feasible futures and disengage from unfeasible ones. We investigated whether participants who effectively regulate their academic and everyday life spontaneously use mental contrasting. Indeed, students who were good self-regulators in the academic domain, as indicated by their high self-reported academic self-regulation skills, high need for achievement, and above-average grades mentally contrasted when writing about an important achievement-related wish (Study 1). So did participants who were good self-regulators in everyday life as indicated by their high self-reported generalized self-regulation skills and high need for cognition (Study 2). Results indicate that successful self-regulation is linked to spontaneous mental contrasting.},

As individuals high in NFC have a propensity to deeper information processing and more elaborated decision-making, we assumed that NFC is associated with higher levels of moral cognition processes and more moral behavior. In two cross-sectional studies, variables of interest were assessed by online surveys with 303 (39\% male, 29.26±11.09years) and 204 participants (26\% male, 27.8±1.3years), respectively. In both studies, NFC predicted self-reported moral behavior and did so incrementally over and above variables clearly referring to morality like moral identity (Study 1) or empathy (Study 2) as well as cognitive reflection. These results highlight the importance to consider NFC in research on moral behavior. Based on our current findings, we introduce a comprehensive approach on dispositions that promote moral behavior and suggest NFC as moral maturation capacity impacting on moral behavior.},

Results indicated that self-esteem, public self-consciousness, and need for cognition may play an important role in predicting individuals' reactions to communicating their own experience with social bias. Specifically, higher scores on the Public Self-Consciousness Scale were correlated with more negative emotions (measured with the PANAS), whereas higher scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were correlated with more positive emotions. Higher scores on the Need for Cognition Scale were associated with heightened positive and negative reactions. Thus, personality variables appear to be an important moderator of the short-term outcomes of expressive writing.},

  abstract  = {In order to activate women to participate in breast cancer screening programs, a good understanding is needed of the personal characteristics that influence how women can be activated to search for more information, consult friends and doctors, and participate in breast cancer screening programs. In the current study, we investigate the effect of six personal characteristics that have in previous research been identified as important triggers of health behavior on breast cancer screening activation: Health awareness, Need for Cognition, Affect Intensity, Breast cancer knowledge, Topic involvement, and the Perceived breast cancer risk. We test the effect of these factors on four activation variables: intention of future information seeking, forwarding the message to a friend, talking to a doctor, and actual breast cancer screening attendance. Additionally, we try to unravel the process by means of which the antecedents (the six personal characteristics) lead to activation. To that end, we test the mediating role of perceived breast cancer threat, perceived efficacy of screening, and the evoked breast cancer anxiety as mediators in this process. The data were collected by means of a cross-sectional survey in a sample of 700 Flemish (Belgium) women who were invited to the free-of-charge breast cancer population screening. Screening attendance of this sample was provided by the government agency in charge of the organisation of the screening. Health awareness, affects intensity, topic involvement, and perceived risk have the strongest influence on activation. Breast cancer anxiety and perceived breast cancer threat have a substantial mediation effect on these effects. Efficacy perceptions are less important in the activation process. Increased health awareness and a higher level of perceived risk lead to less participation in the free of charge population based breast screening program. Implications for theory and practice are offered. The limitation of the study is that only a standard invitation message was used. In future research, other types of awareness and activation messages should be tested. Additionally, the analysis could be refined by investigating the potentially different activation process in different subgroups of women.},

  abstract = {Background: The integrative cognitive model of mood swings proposes that mood symptoms are driven by extreme, self-referent appraisals. For example, if activated mood is appraised positively, this prompts selection of mood regulation strategies that act to up-regulate mood. Appraisals are driven by fast and automatic Type 1 cognitive processes, which, left unchecked, can cause activated mood to escalate. Aims: It was hypothesized that greater propensity to override these automatic processes by engaging in reflective (Type 2) thinking would be negatively associated with extreme appraisals of activation and activation. Method: Study 1 (n = 150) was a cross-sectional survey consisting of measures of activation, extreme appraisals, and an objective performance-based measure of the propensity to engage in reflective thought (cognitive reflection test; CRT). In Study 2 (n = 241) participants completed these measures plus three alternative measures of effortful cognitive engagement (CRT-2, Need for Cognition and Actively Open-Minded Thinking). Results: In Study 1, propensity to engage in reflective thought (higher CRT scores) was not significantly associated with activated mood or extreme appraisals, but activated mood and extreme appraisals were positively correlated. In study 2, the association between activation and extreme appraisals was replicated. Predicted associations between alternative measures of reflective thinking, activated mood, and extreme appraisals were not found. Conclusions: Extreme appraisals of internal states may be a psychological mechanism underlying activated mood. Propensity to reflect on and override default cognitions was unrelated to these extreme appraisals and activated mood. Further research in a clinical sample using mood-relevant measures of reflective thinking is warranted.},

  abstract = {Participation in strategic and non-strategic games is mostly explained in the literature by gender: men gamble on strategic games, while women gamble on non-strategic games. However, little is known about the underlying cognitive factors that could also distinguish strategic and non-strategic gamblers. We suggest that cognitive style and need for cognition also explain participation in gambling subtypes. From a dual-process perspective, cognitive style is the tendency to reject or accept the fast, automatic answer that comes immediately in response to a problem. Individuals that preferentially reject the automatic response use an analytic style, which suggest processing information in a slow way, with deep treatment. The intuitive style supposes a reliance on fast, automatic answers. The need for cognition provides a motivation to engage in effortful activities. One hundred and forty-nine gamblers (53 strategic and 96 non-strategic) answered the Cognitive Reflection Test, Need For Cognition Scale, and socio-demographic questions. A logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the influence of gender, cognitive style and need for cognition on participation in strategic and non-strategic games. Our results show that a model with both gender and cognitive variables is more accurate than a model with gender alone. Analytic (vs. intuitive) style, high (vs. low) need for cognition and being male (vs. female) are characteristics of strategic gamblers (vs. non-strategic gamblers). This study highlights the importance of considering the cognitive characteristics of strategic and non-strategic gamblers in order to develop preventive campaigns and treatments that fit the best profiles for gamblers.},

All participants took part in an online survey that assessed NFC together with school performance and further personality variables via self-report. Success in university was comprehensively operationalized including performance, satisfaction with one’s studies, and thoughts about quitting/changing one’s major as indicators. The value of NFC in predicting tertiary academic success was examined with correlation analyses and path analysis. NFC significantly correlated with all success variables with the highest correlation for study satisfaction. Path analysis confirmed the importance of NFC for study satisfaction showing that NFC had a significant direct effect on study satisfaction and via this variable also a significant indirect effect on termination thoughts. This study clearly indicates that NFC broadly contributes to the mastery of academic requirements and that it is worthwhile to intensify research on NFC in the context of tertiary education.},

Studies 2 and 3 replicated this pattern for stereotypically ambivalent groups, and yielded provocative evidence regarding several putative mechanisms underlying these associations.

The screening behaviors were self-reported prostate cancer screening (prostate-specific antigen testing and digital rectal examinations [DREs]), and colorectal cancer screening (self-reported FOBT participation and recorded uptake of the FOBT offer). Analysis comprised principal component analysis and structural equation modelling. NFC was positively related to demographic variables education, socioeconomic status, and speaking English at home. Faith in intuition was negatively related to educational attainment. NFC predicted variance in self-reported DRE participation (r = .11, p = .016). No other relationships with thinking style were statistically significant. The relationship of NFC to DRE participation may reflect the way certain attributes of this screening method are processed, or alternatively, it may reflect willingness to report participation. The relationship of thinking style to a range of healthy behaviors should be further explored.},

  abstract = {Medical practice is inherently ambiguous and uncertain. The physicians’ ability to tolerate ambiguity and uncertainty has been proved to have a great impact on clinical practice. The primary aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that higher degree of physicians’ ambiguity and uncertainty intolerance and higher need for cognitive closure will predict higher work stress. Two hundred and twelve physicians (mean age = 42.94 years; SD = 10.72) from different medical specialties with different levels of expertise were administered a set of questionnaires measuring perceived levels of work-related stress, individual ability to tolerate ambiguity, stress deriving from uncertainty, and personal need for cognitive closure. A linear regression analysis was performed to examine which variables predict the perceived level of stress. The regression model was statistically significant [R2 = .32; F(10,206) = 8.78, p ≤ .001], thus showing that, after controlling for gender and medical specialty, ambiguity and uncertainty tolerance, decisiveness (a dimension included in need for closure), and the years of practice were significant predictors of perceived work-related stress. Findings from the present study have some implications for medical education. Given the great impact that the individual ability to tolerate ambiguity and uncertainty has on the physicians’ level of perceived work-related stress, it would be worth paying particular attention to such a skill in medical education settings. It would be crucial to introduce or to empower educational tools and strategies that could increase medical students’ ability to tolerate ambiguity and uncertainty.Abbreviations: JSQ: Job stress questionnaire; NFCS: Need for cognitive closure scale; PRU: Physicians’ reactions to uncertainty; TFA: Tolerance for ambiguity},

Yet, it is still unclear which cognitive functions may affect decision-making in such situations. We examined 150 healthy subjects using a new decision-making task that measures people’s ability at handling short- and long-term consequences under objective risk. Two task versions were developed to investigate the effects of feedback about long-term consequences on decision-making. One version includes feedback about changes in long-term prospects while the other does not. Both groups revealed that advantageous decision-making correlated with reasoning and working-memory abilities, however, no correlations with executive functions were found. The effect of feedback on decision-making performance was moderated by impulsivity and need for cognition. Our findings contribute to recent dual-system approaches for risky decision-making by showing that individuals with predispositions towards impulsive rather than reflective information processing could profit from feedback about long-term prospects.},

  abstract   = {The investment trait need for cognition (NFC) is conceptualized as the intrinsic motivation to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors. Higher NFC levels have been shown to be related to a deeper elaboration of information, better performance on cognitive exercises, and more effective complex problem solving, moreover NFC has shown only a moderate relation to (fluid) aspects of intelligence. Surprisingly, NFC has rarely been investigated in school contexts even though all of the aspects listed above are highly relevant for learning and school performance. Here, we present empirical results from a comprehensive collaborative study of 4279 Finnish students (from the 3rd, 6th and 9th grade; 10 to 16years of age) assessed with an NFC scale for children. We observed moderate positive correlations between NFC and behavioral correlates related to learning (ability self-concept, control motivation, learning orientation) for all three grade levels. Furthermore, the analyses revealed no relations between NFC and academic achievement or potential in Grade 3, but positive relations in Grades 6 and 9. The findings accentuate the importance of NFC in educational contexts and suggest a growing influence of NFC over the school-years.},

To better understand the role of genes in politics, we examine the relationship between cognitive style (the need for cognition, the need for cognitive closure) and various measures of political attitudes (issue-based ideology, identity-based ideology, social ideology, economic ideology, authoritarianism, and egalitarianism). We show, for the first time, that the need for cognition and the need for cognitive closure are heritable and are linked to political ideology primarily, perhaps solely, because of shared genetic influences; these links are stronger for social than economic ideology. Although prior research demonstrated that Openness to Experience shares genetic variance with political ideology, we find that these measures of cognitive style account for distinct genetic variance in political ideology. Moreover, the genetic Openness-ideology link is fully accounted for by the need for cognition. This combination of findings provides a clearer understanding of the role of genes in political beliefs and suggests new directions for research on Big Five personality traits and ideology.},

  abstract = {Age related cognitive decline comes at a significant economic, social, and health cost. Interventions that prevent or slow cognitive decline and encourage positive ageing have potential to produce significant societal benefits and are a rapidly growing enterprise. Currently little is known about how individual difference factors influence adherence to the training regimes and training outcomes. The aim of the present study was to identify the personality and metacognitive beliefs that predict individuals' adherence to a regular training regime and the likelihood that they discontinue training. A sample of 831 older Australians drawn from registered users of a commercial brain training program, performed a range of personality and non-cognitive measures, specifically: need for cognition, implicit theories of intelligence, mastery beliefs, memory self-concept, and big-5 personality factors. The training frequency and performance of participants was tracked over an 18-month period. The results suggest that, within a sample of existing brain trainers, openness to experience, need for cognition, and age predicted training discontinuation. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that openness to experience, implicit theories of intelligence, and age influenced game performance. Implications of such findings for the effective design and application of cognitive training for encouraging positive ageing are discussed.},

EC is defined as the efficiency of executive attention, which may be reduced by the attentional impairment associated with depression. However, the mechanism underlying this correlation is still unclear. We investigated the relationship between EC and depressive symptoms with the hypothesis that cognitive motivation, or need for cognition (NfC), is a possible mediator of this relationship. Participants were 178 Japanese university students. Each completed the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, Effortful Control Scale, and Need for Cognition Scale at baseline and follow-up assessments. Supporting our hypothesis, mediation analyses revealed a significant indirect effect of depressive symptoms on EC that was mediated by NfC. In addition, our data demonstrated a direct effect of depressive symptoms on EC. Longitudinal analysis indicated that an increase in depression and a decrease in NfC occurred synchronously, while NfC predicted an increase in EC over time. Depressive symptoms may decrease executive functioning and effortful control both directly and indirectly, the latter effect being mediated by motivation. These findings imply that a motivational deficit may partially explain the decreased EC found in people suffering from depression.},

The current study was designed to: (a) compare the efficacy of emailed interventions differing by message framing and temporal context on alcohol involvement among heavy drinking college students and (b) examine need for cognition (NFC), consideration of future consequences (CFC) and self-efficacy as putative moderators.MethodsHazardous drinking college students (N = 220) were randomly assigned to conditions in a 2 (Frame: gain vs. loss) × 2 (Temporal Context: long-term vs. short-term consequences) factorial design. Participants received four emails on heavy drinking consequences phrased in a manner consistent with their condition. After each message, participants were given a manipulation check. Participants were sent a 1-month follow-up assessment. Primary outcome measures were heavy episodic drinking (HED) and alcohol-related problems. We hypothesized two main effects (less alcohol consumption in the gain-frame and short-term condition), qualified by a Frame × Temporal Context interaction with substantially less alcohol involvement in the gain-frame/short-term condition.ResultsThere was very little study attrition (96.4\% completed follow-up survey, 93.2–99.5\% completed manipulation checks), and strong effects were observed for the manipulations. A 2 × 2 ANCOVA, controlling for baseline alcohol involvement, revealed no consistent main effects or interactions on either outcome. No moderation was observed for any putative moderator.ConclusionsThese results do not replicate prior laboratory-based research. The null findings may be attributed to the heavy drinking sample or electronic means of message delivery.},

Particularly interesting are the implications of contextually-based self-concept variability for the capacity to organize one's self-experience into a stable and coherent identity. In the past, this issue has been addressed from two contrasting perspectives: the fragmentation and the flexibility (specialization) hypothesis. This paper adds to the literature by examining the mediating and moderating effects of cognitive-motivational dispositions on the relationship between trait overlap among self-aspects and sense of personal identity. The analyses suggest this relationship is more complex than previously believed. There was no direct effect of overlap on sense of identity. However, support was found for moderated mediation: higher overlap was associated with higher integrative self-knowledge, which was in turn related to enhanced sense of identity, and the strength of this relation increased with the level of need for cognition (second-stage moderator). Yet, this was true only for individuals low and moderate in reflective self-focus (first-stage moderator).},

  abstract  = {Background: Although Web-based interventions have been shown to be effective, they are not widely implemented in regular care. Nonadherence (ie, participants not following the intervention protocol) is an issue. By studying the way Web-based interventions are used and whether there are differences between adherers (ie, participants that started all 9 lessons) and nonadherers, more insight can be gained into the process of adherence. Objective: The aims of this study were to (1) describe the characteristics of participants and investigate their relationship with adherence, (2) investigate the utilization of the different features of the intervention and possible differences between adherers and nonadherers, and (3) identify what use patterns emerge and whether there are differences between adherers and nonadherers. Methods: Data were used from 206 participants that used the Web-based intervention Living to the full, a Web-based intervention for the prevention of depression employing both a fully automated and human-supported format. Demographic and baseline characteristics of participants were collected by using an online survey. Log data were collected within the Web-based intervention itself. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. Results: In all, 118 participants fully adhered to the intervention (ie, started all 9 lessons). Participants with an ethnicity other than Dutch were more often adherers (\&\#967; 2  1 =5.5,  P =.02), and nonadherers used the Internet more hours per day on average (F 1,203 =3.918,  P =.049). A logistic regression showed that being female (OR 2.02, 95\% CI 1.01-4.04;  P =.046) and having a higher need for cognition (OR 1.02; 95\% CI 1.00-1.05;  P =.02) increased the odds of adhering to the intervention. Overall, participants logged in an average of 4 times per lesson, but adherers logged in significantly more times per lesson than nonadherers (F 1,204 =20.710;  P \&\#60;.001). For use patterns, we saw that early nonadherers seemed to use fewer sessions and spend less time than late nonadherers and adherers, and fewer sessions to complete the lesson than adherers. Furthermore, late nonadherers seemed to have a shorter total duration of sessions than adherers. Conclusions: By using log data combined with baseline characteristics of participants, we extracted valuable lessons for redesign of this intervention and the design of Web-based interventions in general. First, although characteristics of respondents can significantly predict adherence, their predictive value is small. Second, it is important to design Web-based interventions to foster adherence and usage of all features in an intervention.

Using a nationally representative random digit dialing telephone survey of 1,055 adult Singaporeans, the authors' results show that the cognitive mediation model can be applied to health contexts, in which motivations (surveillance gratification, guidance, and need for cognition) were positively associated with news attention, elaboration, and interpersonal communication. News attention, elaboration, and interpersonal communication in turn positively influence public knowledge about the H1N1 influenza. In addition, results show that the motivations have significant indirect effects on behavioral intentions, as partially mediated by communication (media attention and interpersonal communication), elaboration, and knowledge. The authors conclude that the cognitive mediation model can be extended to behavioral outcomes, above and beyond knowledge. Implications for theory and practice for health communication were discussed.},

  abstract   = {Recent research on moral decision-making has suggested that many common moral judgments are based on immediate intuitions. However, some individuals arrive at highly counterintuitive utilitarian conclusions about when it is permissible to harm other individuals. Such utilitarian judgments have been attributed to effortful reasoning that has overcome our natural emotional aversion to harming others. Recent studies, however, suggest that such utilitarian judgments might also result from a decreased aversion to harming others, due to a deficit in empathic concern and social emotion. The present study investigated the neural basis of such indifference to harming using functional neuroimaging during engagement in moral dilemmas. A tendency to counterintuitive utilitarian judgment was associated both with ‘psychoticism’, a trait associated with a lack of empathic concern and antisocial tendencies, and with ‘need for cognition’, a trait reflecting preference for effortful cognition. Importantly, only psychoticism was also negatively correlated with activation in the subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC), a brain area implicated in empathic concern and social emotions such as guilt, during counterintuitive utilitarian judgments. Our findings suggest that when individuals reach highly counterintuitive utilitarian conclusions, this need not reflect greater engagement in explicit moral deliberation. It may rather reflect a lack of empathic concern, and diminished aversion to harming others.},

NFC, dispositional self-control capacity, self-esteem, habitual depressive mood, and tendency to respond in a socially desirable manner were measured among 150 university students via self-report. Regression analyses and Sobel tests revealed that self-control capacity was a potential mediator of the positive relationship between NFC and affective adjustment.

Meanwhile, those who spent more time on SNS were more likely to be multitaskers. Additionally, those who spent more time on SNS also spent more Internet time in general, more online time for study/work and more time in surfing the Web with no specific purpose.

Findings from this data set indicate that individuals who talked with their physician about a specific medication were more likely to be female, older, higher in need for cognition, and reported higher physician satisfaction.

We tested these hypotheses with a sample of 176 sedentary young adults who read an exercise message with randomly assigned frame (gain/loss) and outcome (intrinsic/extrinsic). Participants provided daily reports of exercise over the following week. The predicted interaction between frame, outcome and NC was found (p = 0.001) such that a ‘fit’ message promoted somewhat, but not significantly, greater exercise for those with high NC, but a ‘non-fit’ message promoted significantly greater exercise for those with low NC. Furthermore, differences in physical activity were partially mediated by attitudes towards exercise. Findings shed light on how the outcomes and motivations associated with physical activity shape people's behavioural responses to framed health communications.},

However, little is known about variables that may qualify the effectiveness of these approaches. The present analyses tested the hypothesis that need for cognition (NFC), impulsivity/sensation-seeking (IMPSS) and readiness to change (RTC) would moderate the effects of BMI and AEC. Participants (N = 335) were heavy drinking college students enrolled in a randomized 2×2 factorial study of BMI and AEC. Latent growth curve analyses indicated significant interactions for BMI × NFC and AEC × RTC on alcohol use but not problems. Simple slopes analyses were used to probe these relationships and revealed that higher levels of NFC at baseline were associated with a stronger BMI effect on drinking outcomes over time. Similarly, higher levels of baseline RTC were associated with stronger AEC effects on alcohol use. Future preventive interventions with this population may profit by considering individual differences and targeting approaches accordingly.},

A series of hierarchical regression analyses showed PFT made a significant contribution to death acceptance over the contributions of other cognitive and demographic variables, as predicted. Further, PFT made a significant contribution to death integration but not to death confrontation. These results are consistent with contemporary theories of adult cognitive development and PFT.},

  abstract = {Need for cognition is usually characterized as an intrinsic desire to engage in challenging intellectual activity. In achievement situations, however, it could be associated with more extrinsic goals such as success or the avoidance of failure. Three experiments examined this possibility. Participants in all studies were led to believe they would perform either an easy or a difficult intellectual task that they were likely to fail. After inducing this expectation, indices of extrinsic motivation were obtained. Participants with high need for cognition became more motivated to avoid negative consequences of their behavior (e.g., failure) when they expected the task they would perform to be difficult. In contrast, participants with low need for cognition were not appreciably affected by these expectancies. The anticipation of engaging in intellectual activity apparently stimulates different motives in people with high and low need for cognition, and the mindset induced by these motives influences their later behavioral decisions.

Results provide support for the importance of a cognitive and motivational individual-difference variable in the development of a unique and cohesive identity.},

In addition, IFB scores were not unduly influenced by test-taking response sets, and they were positively associated with depression and phobic anxiety and negatively correlated with self-esteem and need for cognition.

PA was positively correlated with participants’ susceptibility to illusory arm extension and, exclusively for men, also to nose elongation.

Participants consisted of 179 college undergraduates from a midsized public university in the southeastern United States. Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses, conducted separately for males and females, indicated several main effects for both cognitive alcohol expectancies and need for cognition on alcohol use. In contrast to these main effects, there were no significant multiplicative interaction effects, suggesting that need for cognition did not moderate the direction of association between cognitive expectancies and drinking. The results of homologizer/moderator analyses, however, did indicate a number of significant interaction effects for both males and females. These significant homologizer findings indicated that thestrength of association between cognitive alcohol expectancies and drinking increased as need for cognition increased.

This research used photo essays about the self as the medium for operationalizing self-construals that are unlike others (i.e., are uniquely creative, abstract, self-reflective, and multidimensional). Two studies (N = 591) are reported in which individuality, rated from photo essays, was related to a variety of markers for an interest in ideas. First, in a new analysis of previously published data, we related individuality to the Clark-Trow typology of major college student philosophies. As expected, students who endorsed an intellectual philosophy of attending college, relative to those endorsing the vocational philosophy, showed greater individuality. Second, in 2 new samples, individuality was predicted and found to correlate with the intellectual philosophy of college as well as intellectual openness, investigative vocational interests, need for cognition, and trait curiosity. Qualitative analyses of photo essays by the participants with the highest and lowest inquiring intellect helped articulate these differences. Findings bear on the openness versus intellect controversy among "big five" researchers and suggest that self-creativity is related to both aesthetically open and intellectual orientations.},

The second phase revealed that the need for affect is related to a number of individual differences in cognitive processes (e.g., need for cognition, need for closure), emotional processes (e.g., affect intensity, repression-sensitization), behavioral inhibition and activation (e.g., sensation seeking), and aspects of personality (Big Five dimensions) in the expected directions, while not being redundant with them. The third phase of the research indicated that, compared to people low in the need for affect, people high in the need for affect are more likely to (a) possess extreme attitudes across a variety of issues, (b) choose to view emotional movies, and (c) become involved in an emotion-inducing event (the death of Princess Diana). Overall, the results indicate that the need for affect is an important construct in understanding emotion-related processes.},

  abstract   = {Germans spend an average of more than 3 hours watching television each day. Among them, there are many who turn on their TV sets for less than 1.5 hours a day, and others who do this for more than 8 hours a day. What accounts for these differences? The central thesis in this paper is that individuals may be distinguished by their attitude toward thinking and that differences in their need for cognition explain the differences in their time spent with TV. The lower viewers' need for cognition is, the less pleasant they feel when they have nothing to do because there is nothing left to do but think. The easiest way for individuals to escape this pressure to think is by watching TV. Thus, individuals will watch more TV when they have a lower need for cognition. Results of a survey study show that the concept of escapism proves to be useful in explaining TV use when it takes over a psychological perspective as well as a sociological one.},

Data from 93 participants (47 males, 46 females, mean age 21.3 yrs., SD = 3.5) show that dream recall frequency (DRF) correlates marginally with neuroticism (r = .20) and interrogative suggestibility (r = .21), the latter result indicating that DRF obtained by questionnaire may be subject to demand bias. DRF had very low correlations with various other personality variables (need for cognition, personal locus of control, hypochondriasis, morningness-eveningness), and with narrative memory, confabulation of narrative memory, and habitual sleep length. DRF correlated positively with POMS elated (-depressed) for males (r = .31) but negatively for females (r = −.19), this significant difference in correlations may be due to sex differences in DRF in response to stress. The frequent findings of small or nonsignificant correlations between DRF and personality are discussed in terms of similar low correlations in personality psychology, but we conclude that DRF is usually sampled adequately, and that the results of no simple relationship with personality (except boundariness, creativity, and positive attitude towards dreams) are therefore robust and may indicate that dream recall is mainly determined physiologically.},

Important individual differences in these biases were found. Particularly regarding academic/career events, those with superior intellectual ability expressed more bias than their peers. Surprisingly, even students in the bottom third of intellectual ability displayed considerable academic/career bias. Cognitive style was also linked with the extensiveness of biased perceptions: individuals high in Need for Cognition were more optimistically biased than their peers in the academic/career domain. Also, relative to participants whose cognitive style was more rational, those who relied on intuitive processing believed that both positive and negative events were more likely to be experienced, by both the self and others. Finally, students who eventually dropped out of college were lower in Need for Cognition and had more unrealistic expectations regarding both positive and negative life events than students who remained in school. These findings are discussed in terms of general adolescent phenomena, such as individuation, identity, and the personal fable, and cognitive factors, such as the knowledge of base rate information and the availability heuristic.},

As predicted, the results showed that individuals low in need for cognition possessed greater boredom proneness scores. That is, individuals who were less likely to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activities were more prone to experience the negative affect of boredom when compared to high need-for-cognition persons. It appears that individuals who are more inclined to provide their own stimulation are more apt to escape the negative experiences of boredom.

This outcome conformed with the authors' expectations that SR would have negative mental health implications, but other data revealed complexities in the SR association with adjustment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While most modern research focuses on the clinical benefits of mindfulness, an emerging body of work suggests that mindfulness can facilitate self-regulation of everyday thinking in typically developing individuals. This behaviour is best captured using critical thinking assessments. The aim of this paper is to describe a rigorous, pre-registered study which will investigate the effect of an online mindfulness intervention on Executive Functioning, critical thinking skills and associated thinking dispositions.
METHOD: The design employed is a randomised-controlled 2 (condition) X 2 (time) parallel-group design which is explanatory in nature. A sample of at least 60 participants will be recruited from the pool of students at NUI Galway, with those between the ages of 18 and 65 with an adequate level of English included. Participants will be randomly assigned following screening, using block randomisation with a fixed block of 6 and a 1:1 ratio, to either the mindfulness meditation group or a sham meditation group. Both groups will be given access to the Headspace app. This is an app which provides guided meditations to users. Participants in each group will receive unique codes granting access to either the experimental or active-control intervention materials. Group allocation will be double-blinded. The primary outcome measures will assess mindfulness, executive functioning, critical thinking, actively open-minded thinking and need for cognition. Secondary outcome measures will assess eudaimonic and hedonic wellbeing, positive and negative affect, and real-world outcomes. These will be measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Manipulation checks will assess adherence to the intervention, meditation quality and task difficulty and enjoyment.
DISCUSSION: If this intervention proves effective, it will show the potential of mindfulness practice to facilitate everyday critical thinking and should stimulate more interest in this line of research. If ineffective, claims regarding mindfulness and thinking skills should be tempered. This research was funded by a Galway Doctoral Research Scholarship awarded to the first author and was facilitated by Headspace Inc. who provided the intervention materials. The trial is registered in the ISRCTN registry and any protocol amendments will be recorded there (RCT ID: ISRCTN16588423. Registered 7th January 2016).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decision-making relies on both analytical and emotional thinking. Cognitive reasoning styles (e.g. maximizing and satisficing tendencies) heavily influence analytical processes, while affective processes are often dependent on regret. The relationship between regret and cognitive reasoning styles has not been well studied in physicians, and is the focus of this paper.
METHODS: A regret questionnaire and 6 scales measuring individual differences in cognitive styles (maximizing-satisficing tendencies; analytical vs. intuitive reasoning; need for cognition; intolerance toward ambiguity; objectivism; and cognitive reflection) were administered through a web-based survey to physicians of the University of South Florida. Bonferroni's adjustment was applied to the overall correlation analysis. The correlation analysis was also performed without Bonferroni's correction, given the strong theoretical rationale indicating the need for a separate hypothesis. We also conducted a multivariate regression analysis to identify the unique influence of predictors on regret.
RESULTS: 165 trainees and 56 attending physicians (age range 25 to 69) participated in the survey. After bivariate analysis we found that maximizing tendency positively correlated with regret with respect to both decision difficulty (r=0.673; p{\textless}0.001) and alternate search strategy (r=0.239; p=0.002). When Bonferroni's correction was not applied, we also found a negative relationship between satisficing tendency and regret (r=-0.156; p=0.021). In trainees, but not faculty, regret negatively correlated with rational-analytical thinking (r=-0.422; p{\textless}0.001), need for cognition (r=-0.340; p{\textless}0.001), and objectivism (r=-0.309; p=0.003) and positively correlated with ambiguity intolerance (r=0.285; p=0.012). However, after conducting a multivariate regression analysis, we found that regret was positively associated with maximizing only with respect to decision difficulty (r=0.791; p{\textless}0.001), while it was negatively associated with satisficing (r=-0.257; p=0.020) and objectivism (r=-0.267; p=0.034). We found no statistically significant relationship between regret and overall accuracy on conditional inferential tasks.
CONCLUSION: Regret in physicians is strongly associated with their tendency to maximize; i.e. the tendency to consider more choices among abundant options leads to more regret. However, physicians who exhibit satisficing tendency - the inclination to accept a "good enough" solution - feel less regret. Our observation that objectivism is a negative predictor of regret indicates that the tendency to seek and use empirical data in decision-making leads to less regret. Therefore, promotion of evidence-based reasoning may lead to lower regret.},

METHOD: Longitudinal data from 332 adults aged 20-85 years were examined. Motivation was assessed using a composite of Need for Cognition and Personal Need for Structure and additional measures of health, sensory functioning, cognitive ability, and self-reported activity engagement.
RESULTS: Multilevel modeling revealed that age-typical changes in health, sensory functions, and ability were associated with changes in motivation, with the impact of declining health on motivation being particularly strong in older adulthood. Changes in motivation, in turn, predicted involvement in cognitive and social activities as well as changes in cognitive ability. Finally, motivation was observed to partially mediate the relationship between changes in resources and cognitively demanding activities.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that motivation may play an important role in determining the course of cognitive change and involvement in cognitively demanding everyday activities in adulthood.},

The Rational-Experiential Inventory (REI) was constructed to measure the 2 independent processing modes with a modified Need for Cognition Scale (NFC, J.T. Cacioppo \& R.E. Petty, 1982) and a new scale, Faith in Intuition (FI). In Study 1, a factor analysis yielded 2 orthogonal factors corresponding to NFC and FI. Although heuristic processing was determined primarily by FI, NFC also contributed to heuristic responding, in line with CEST. The relation of FI and NFC to coping ability also was examined. In Study 2, the factor structure of the REI was replicated (N = 973). NFC and FI were differentially related to measures of personality, adjustment, achievement, and interpersonal relations.},

So far, little attention has been paid to a systematic evaluation of the distinctiveness of NFC from traits with similar conceptualization and from intelligence. The present research contributes to filling this gap by examining the relation of NFC to well-established personality concepts (Study 1) and to a comprehensive measure of intelligence in a sample with broad educational backgrounds (Study 2). We observed NFC to be positively correlated with openness, emotional stability, and traits indicating goal orientation. Using confirmatory factor analysis and event-related potentials, incremental validity of NFC and openness to ideas was demonstrated, showing that NFC is more predictive of drive-related and goal-oriented behavior and attentional resource allocation. Regarding intelligence, NFC was more associated with fluid than with crystallized aspects of intelligence. Altogether, the results provide strong support for the conceptual autonomy of NFC.},

  abstract = {Work on the psychological aftermath of traumatic events suggests that people ordinarily operate on the basis of unchallenged, unquestioned assumptions about themselves and the world. A heuristic model specifying the content of people's assumptive worlds is proposed. The schema construct in social cognition is used to explore the role of these basic assumptions following traumatic events. A major coping task confronting victims is a cognitive one, that of assimilating their experience and/or changing their basic schemas about themselves and their world. Various seemingly inappropriate coping strategies, including self-blame, denial, and intrusive, recurrent thoughts, are discussed from the perspective of facilitating the victim's cognitive coping task. A scale for measuring basic assumptions is presented, as is a study comparing the assumptive worlds of people who did or did not experience particular traumatic events in the past. Results showed that assumptions about the benevolence of the impersonal world, chance, and self-worth differed across the two populations. Findings suggest that people's assumptive worlds are affected by traumatic events, and the impact on basic assumptions is still apparent years after the negative event. Further research directions suggested by work on schemas are briefly discussed.},

More specifically, we use a cross-lagged design to test a mediation model explaining the effects of need for cognition on egocentric network characteristics. We used the data available in the LISS panel, in which a probabilistic sample of Dutch participants were asked to fill in surveys annually. We tested our model on data collected in three successive years and our results show that people scoring high in need for cognition tend to revolve in information-rich egocentric networks, characterized by high demographic diversity, high interpersonal dissimilarity and high average education. The results also show that the effect of need for cognition on social network characteristics is mediated by non-prejudicial judgments.},

This review provides a historical overview of physical activity interventions designed by American educators and an evaluation of research that has assessed the effects of exercise on children's mental function. Method. Historical descriptions of the emergence of American physical education doctrine throughout the 20th century were evaluated. Prior reviews of studies that assessed the effects of single acute bouts of exercise and the effects of chronic exercise training on children's mental function were examined and the results of recent studies were summarized. Results. Physical activity interventions designed for American children have reflected two competing views: activities should promote physical fitness and activities should promote social, emotional, and intellectual development. Research results indicate that exercise fosters the emergence of children's mental function; particularly executive functioning. The route by which physical activity impacts mental functioning is complex and is likely moderated by several variables, including physical fitness level, health status, and numerous psycho-social factors. Conclusion. Physical activity interventions for children should be designed to meet multiple objectives; e.g., optimize physical fitness, promote health-related behaviors that offset obesity, and facilitate mental development.

However, findings from basic and applied attitude research suggest that the extent to which attitudes are based on affective and cognitive information is contingent on stable individual differences, in particular need for affect. Based on current conceptualizations of job satisfaction as an attitude toward the job, we hypothesized that job satisfaction depends more on affect and less on cognitions, the higher a person's need for affect is. To test these hypotheses, we conducted two correlational studies (N=194 university employees; N=134 employees from various organizations) as well as an experimental study (N=191 university employees) in which the salience of positive versus negative job cognitions was varied. Results supported our hypotheses. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these differences in affective and cognitive underpinnings of job satisfaction.},

Adult participants (n = 2,097) drawn from community, college, and BDSM community samples completed a health survey via online administration. Bivariate tests were used to identify correlates of elevated suicide risk, and logistic regression was employed to test primary hypotheses. Results yielded the following indicators of elevated suicide risk category membership: (1) female gender, (2) BDSM community membership, (3) lesbian, gay, bisexual and other sexual orientation identity minority status, (4) elevated depressive symptoms, (5) elevated NFA approach, and (6) elevated NFA Avoidance. BDSM and NFA results are largely new, and speak to the need for further attention. Results are discussed with respect to information processing preferences, as well as the intersection of sexuality-based marginalized groups, stigma, and health disparities.

Neuroticism is a robust correlate and predictor of many different mental and physical disorders, comorbidity among them, and the frequency of mental and general health service use. Indeed, neuroticism apparently is a predictor of the quality and longevity of our lives. Achieving a full understanding of the nature and origins of neuroticism, and the mechanisms through which neuroticism is linked to mental and physical disorders, should be a top priority for research. Knowing why neuroticism predicts such a wide variety of seemingly diverse outcomes should lead to improved understanding of commonalities among those outcomes and improved strategies for preventing them.},

  abstract = {Dissociation is defined as the separation of those processes that should be accessible, considering that both somatoform and conversion symptoms may be understood as dissociative. In recent decades, psychological variables have been related to dissociation, such as suggestibility, fantasy, alexithymia, abnormal emotional processes, and also a particular personality profile. The aim of this paper is to study the profile associated with psychoform and somatoform dissociation. The sample consisted of 355 participants. University students employed the snowball sampling. The following instruments were used: the Dissociative Experiences Scale-II (DES-II), the Questionnaire Somatoform Dissociation (SDQ-20), the Inventory Suggestibility (IS), the Alexithymia Scale Toronto (TAS-20), the Scale Difficulties in Emotion Regulation (DERS), the revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI), and some ad hoc questions to evaluate sleep-related experiences. The results indicated that high dissociators showed higher scores on suggestibility, alexithymia, sleep- related experiences, neuroticism, openness to experience, and lower conscientiousness than low dissociators, the results being similar to those obtained by high somatizers. As a conclusion, the profile found in both types of dissociation indicated their existing relationship, and pointed out possible lines of future research and treatment.
Resumen
La disociación se define como la separación de procesos que deberían ser accesibles, considerándose que los síntomas somatomorfos y conversivos pueden entenderse como disociativos. En las últimas décadas se han encontrado variables psicológicas relacionadas con la disociación, como la sugestionabilidad, la fantasía, alexitimia, alteraciones en los procesos emocionales y un perfil concreto de personalidad. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar el perfil asociado a la disociación psicoforme y somaforme. La muestra estuvo compuesta por 355 participantes. El muestreo consistió en la bola de nieve por parte de estudiantes universitarios. Para su realización se utilizó la Escala de Experiencias Disociativas-II (DES-II), el Cuestionario de Disociación Somatoforme (SDQ-20), el Inventario de Sugestionabilidad (IS), la Escala de Alexitimia de Toronto (TAS-20), la Escala de Dificultades en la Regulación Emocional (DERS), el Inventario de Personalidad NEO revisado (NEO-PI) y preguntas elaboradas ad hoc para evaluar experiencias relacionadas con el sueño. Los sujetos con elevada disociación mostraron mayores puntuaciones en sugestionabilidad, alexitimia, experiencias de sueño, neuroticismo y apertura y menores en responsabilidad, de forma muy similar al grupo de sujetos de elevada somatización. Puede concluirse que el perfil hallado en ambos tipos de disociación refleja la relación existente entre ambas y señala posibles líneas de investigación y tratamiento futuros.},

Depressed participants exhibited significantly higher scores than nondepressed controls on two facets of Openness (Aesthetics and Feelings). Openness to Experience was also found to account for a significant proportion of the variance in depression scores, beyond the variance accounted for by Neuroticism and Extraversion. The facet of Openness to Aesthetics appeared to be most strongly related to depression scores, and the facet of Openness to Fantasy was implicated as a moderator of the relation between Extraversion and depression.},

This study examined the contributory roles of personality traits, posttraumatic stress (PTS) severity and their interactions on PTG and its domains, as assessed with the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory Turkish form (PTGI-T). The study also examined the differences in PTG domains between survivors of accidents, natural disasters and unexpected loss of a loved one.MethodThe Basic Personality Traits Inventory, Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale, and PTGI-T were administered to a large stratified cluster community sample of 969 Turkish adults in their home settings.ResultsThe results showed that conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness to experience significantly related to the total PTG and most of the domains. The effects of extraversion, neuroticism and openness to experience were moderated by the PTS severity for some domains. PTG in relating to others and appreciation of life domains was lower for the bereaved group.ConclusionFurther research should examine the mediating role of coping between personality and PTG using a longitudinal design.},

Two-multilevel structural models were tested to determine the relationship between physical activity and QoL.ResultsBoth structural models suggested that the relationship between physical activity and QoL is indirect, but the models were not significantly different. In model 1, we observed a positive linear relationship between physical activity and self-efficacy. In turn, self-efficacy was negatively associated with poor mental health difficulties and positively associated with QoL. Mental health difficulties were also negatively associated with QoL. In model 2, physical activity was positively associated with self-efficacy and negatively associated with mental health difficulties; in turn, self-efficacy was positively associated with QoL, whereas mental health difficulties were negatively associated with QoL.ConclusionsOverall, our findings suggest that self-efficacy and mental health have intermediary roles in the relationship between physical activity and QoL in a diverse sample of older adults. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether self-efficacy and mental health difficulties are complementary or one or the other accounts for more variance in the relationship between physical activity and QoL.},

The role of general self-efficacy on the relationship between daily stress and aspects of mental health has not yet been examined. Taking into account the dual factor model of mental health, which postulates that mental health is more than the absence of psychopathological symptoms, we tested mediation effects of self-efficacy separately for positive and negative mental health. Total, direct and indirect effects were estimated using data from a large nationally representative German population sample (N = 1,031) by bootstrapped mediation analyses providing 95\% bias corrected bootstrap confidence intervals. Results indicated self-efficacy as a mediator of the effects of daily stressors on mental health, with superior effect sizes for positive compared to negative mental health. Mediation effects were replicated in student samples from Germany (N=394), Russia (N=604) and China (N=8,669). Findings suggest that self-efficacy operates as a buffer of daily stress. However, a full mediation model was not supported as multiple psychological resources can have protective effects. This study provides the first transnational evidence for different stress-buffer effects for the two dimensions of mental health.
Resumen
El estrés cotidiano, en comparación con acontecimientos traumáticos, es reconocido cada vez más como un importante factor de riesgo para la salud mental. El papel de la autoeficacia general en la relación entre estrés diario y aspectos de la salud mental todavía no se ha examinado. Teniendo en cuenta el modelo de dos factores, que postula que la salud mental es más que la ausencia de síntomas psicopatológicos, examinamos la mediación de la autoeficacia separadamente para la salud mental positiva y negativa. Efectos totales, directos e indirectos fueron evaluados, utilizando datos de una muestra de la población alemana representativa (N=1.031). La autoeficacia es un mediador de los efectos del estrés cotidiano, con efectos superiores para la salud mental positiva. Los resultados fueron replicados en muestras de estudiantes de Alemania (N=394), Rusia (N=604) y China (N=8.669). La autoeficacia actúa como un búfer para el estrés cotidiano. Un modelo de mediación completo no fue apoyado con múltiples recursos psicológicos que pueden tener efectos protectores. Es la primera evidencia transnacional para diferentes efectos del búfer-estrés para las dos dimensiones de salud mental.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Fear of cancer recurrence is an important clinical phenomenon and is associated with decrements in life domains. The study goals were to characterize patterns of global fear of recurrence (FOR) and 4 domains of fear (health, role, womanhood, and death worry) over time in women who were diagnosed with gynecological cancer and to identify demographic, medical, and psychological predictors of FOR.
METHOD: One hundred eighteen women participating in the usual care arm of a randomized trial completed the Concerns about Recurrence scale as well as measures of depressive symptoms, cancer-specific distress, coping, coping efficacy, and social network responses at 4 time points. The majority of the sample was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer.
RESULTS: Group-based trajectory modeling identified subgroups of women with high-stable (49.1\%), high-decreasing (25.3\%), and low-stable (25.5\%) trajectories for global FOR. For role worries, 3 similar group trajectories were identified. For health worries, modeling identified subgroups with high-decreasing (19.1\%) and low-increasing (80.9\%) trajectories. For womanhood worries, modeling identified subgroups with high-increasing (15.7\%) and low-decreasing (84.2\%) trajectories. Young age, metastatic cancer, depression, cancer distress, holding back, and lower coping efficacy were associated with the high-stable global FOR and at least 1 domain of FOR.
CONCLUSION: Almost half of the women recently diagnosed with gynecological cancer evidence persistently elevated FOR over the 6-month period postdiagnosis. Psychological interventions to reduce FOR may be more effective if they focus on teaching patients coping skills, as well as greater comfort expressing cancer-specific concerns to others.},

It is assumed that worries have two facets, namely, the object of a worry (e.g., self, close others, society, the world) and the domain of a worry (the field of life with which it is concerned). The object of a worry is presumed to be more important than its domain in determining the impact of worries on mental health. Only worries concerned with self and close others (micro worries) are expected to be related to poor mental health, whereas worries about society or the entire world (macro worries) are expected to be positively related to mental health. An instrument is introduced to study worries in accordance with the proposed structure. Its validity is tested by two confirmatory techniques (similarity structure analysis and confirmatory factor analysis) in samples from Israel, West Germany, and (the former) East Germany. Worry scores are also related to five mental health indicators. Results show that across samples micro and macro worries can validly be distinguished. Micro worries are strongly related to poor mental health, whereas macro worries are unrelated to mental health or relate marginally to positive well-being.},

In a sample of 1,621 college students, individuals in committed relationships experienced fewer mental health problems and were less likely to be overweight/obese. There were no significant differences between groups in frequency of physical health problems. Examination of 2 models suggested that being in a committed romantic relationship decreases problematic outcomes largely through a reduction in sexual partners, which in turn decreases both risky behaviors and problematic outcomes. These results are discussed in the context of how premarital dating relationships may contribute to understanding of the observed association between marriage and well-being.},

Although much has been written about how to empower a recovering person to develop a more positive identity, an important area which seems relatively underdeveloped in the literature pertains to the challenges and suffering borne from the process of recovery itself. The current paper will suggest that there are four related, though independent, challenges associated with the recovery process that practitioners should be prepared to address: (1) the discomfort elicited by the loss of, or threats to, a previous sense of identity, (2) the loss of previous ways of making meaning of the world, (3) awareness of concrete losses in one’s life which have occurred, and (4) accepting oneself as an ordinary, though agentic, person. For each we will review experimental, clinical, and first-person literature and refer to an illustrative vignette. Through recognition of these potentially painful challenges, practitioners may be even more effective in supporting recovery.},

Method:
We used linear regression to examine factors associated with grief severity using a cross-sectional analysis and logistic regression to determine prospective associations.

Results:
Cross-sectionaly, females, child-lost, higher depressive symptoms, lower education, and difficulties in daily activities were independently associated with a higher bereavement severity. Prospectively (6 years; response rate 71\%), the baseline value of the grief severity was the single predictor significantly associated with grief persistence.

Discussion:
Our results suggest that only grief severity is independently associated with grief persistence. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.},

  abstract   = {Idioms of distress communicate suffering via reference to shared ethnopsychologies, and better understanding of idioms of distress can contribute to effective clinical and public health communication. This systematic review is a qualitative synthesis of “thinking too much” idioms globally, to determine their applicability and variability across cultures. We searched eight databases and retained publications if they included empirical quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods research regarding a “thinking too much” idiom and were in English. In total, 138 publications from 1979 to 2014 met inclusion criteria. We examined the descriptive epidemiology, phenomenology, etiology, and course of “thinking too much” idioms and compared them to psychiatric constructs. “Thinking too much” idioms typically reference ruminative, intrusive, and anxious thoughts and result in a range of perceived complications, physical and mental illnesses, or even death. These idioms appear to have variable overlap with common psychiatric constructs, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. However, “thinking too much” idioms reflect aspects of experience, distress, and social positioning not captured by psychiatric diagnoses and often show wide within-cultural variation, in addition to between-cultural differences. Taken together, these findings suggest that “thinking too much” should not be interpreted as a gloss for psychiatric disorder nor assumed to be a unitary symptom or syndrome within a culture. We suggest five key ways in which engagement with “thinking too much” idioms can improve global mental health research and interventions: it (1) incorporates a key idiom of distress into measurement and screening to improve validity of efforts at identifying those in need of services and tracking treatment outcomes; (2) facilitates exploration of ethnopsychology in order to bolster cultural appropriateness of interventions; (3) strengthens public health communication to encourage engagement in treatment; (4) reduces stigma by enhancing understanding, promoting treatment-seeking, and avoiding unintentionally contributing to stigmatization; and (5) identifies a key locally salient treatment target.},

The study examined the relationship between these concepts and also the association between the concepts and psychological health. Fifty-eight participants with a diagnosis of severe and enduring mental health problems were assessed recording levels of self-esteem, self-acceptance, depression, anxiety and psychological well-being. The results revealed that, in comparison with the general population, the sample were more likely to have lower self-acceptance and self-esteem, and higher levels of anxiety, depression and psychological ill health. The concepts of self-esteem and self-acceptance were found to be similar but not synonymous. Self-esteem was more closely associated with affect, with higher levels of self-esteem being indicative of lower levels of depression. Self-acceptance appeared to be more closely associated with general psychological well-being and to be more helpful when undertaking clinical work for general psychological problems.},

Internet addiction is becoming a serious mental health problem in some countries, and has been proposed for inclusion in DSM-V. Social network sites (SNS) are proliferating and have attracted millions. However, there has been recent concern about potential abuse of social web, suggesting that “Facebook addiction” could be another subcategory of the spectrum of Internet addiction disorders. Unfortunately, there is sparse data to show whether SNS are of benefit or detriment to mental health.
Objectives
1.Exemplify how excessive use of SNS may lead to dysfunction.2.Summarize recent knowledge on the impact SNS may have on mental health.
Aims
We present a case of a 14-year-old adolescent who was referred to our institution due to excessive Internet/Facebook use, leading to some risky behaviors. Subsequently, we embark on a literature review about outcomes on mental health associated with SNS use.
Methods
We conducted a literature review of journal articles from EMBASE, MEDLINE and PSYCINFO, using the keywords “social network”, “Facebook” and “addiction”. Papers published from 2006 to 2011 were selected on the basis of relevant information contained in the title/abstract.
Results
A brief summary of all relevant articles shall be presented in table format.
Conclusions
Nowadays Facebook is the most popular SNS, allowing users to real-time interaction and increased socialization, being used for personal, academic or work purposes. Personal information on SNS can be maliciously used by others, and may reflect user's habits, personality traits and psychopathology. Mental health professionals should be aware of Internet addiction disorders.},

Girls, however, who actively use Facebook, either in a public setting or in a private setting and subsequently perceive online social support, benefit from actively using Facebook, as perceived online social support negatively predicted girls’ depressed mood.

The findings suggest that the relationship between online social networking and symptoms of depression may be complex and associated with multiple psychological, social, behavioral, and individual factors. Furthermore, the impact of online social networking on wellbeing may be both positive and negative, highlighting the need for future research to determine the impact of candidate mediators and moderators underlying these heterogeneous outcomes across evolving networks.},

Tests for curvilinearity failed to indicate any drawbacks of so-called overcontrol, and the positive effects remained after controlling for social desirability. Low self-control is thus a significant risk factor for a broad range of personal and interpersonal problems.},

Participants high (vs. low) in self-control generated fewer death-related thoughts after being primed with death, reported less death anxiety, were less likely to perceive death-related themes in ambiguous scenes, and reacted with less worldview defense when mortality was made salient. Further, coping with thoughts of death led to self-regulatory fatigue. After writing about death versus a control topic, participants performed worse on several measures of self-regulation that were irrelevant to death. These results suggest that self-regulation is a key intrapsychic mechanism for alleviating troublesome thoughts and feelings about mortality.},

A haplotype of alleles T-A-T in a set of common polymorphisms in the gene encoding for CRF1 (CRHR1) has been associated with both depression vulnerability and alterations in cognitive functioning. The present study investigated the relations between the TAT haplotype and specific symptoms of depression, self-reported ruminative behaviors, and neuropsychological performance on a learning and memory task. Participants were adults with major depression with and without psychotic features (N = 406). Associations were examined between TAT haplotype and endorsement of depression symptoms from diagnostic interviews, scores on the rumination response scale (RRS), and verbal memory performance on the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II). All analyses included depression subtype, age, and sex as covariates; CVLT-II analyses also included evening cortisol levels. Across the entire sample, carriers of more copies of the TAT haplotype reported greater endorsement of the symptom describing difficulty concentrating and making decisions. In separate subsamples, TAT homozygotes had higher rumination scores on the RRS, both brooding and reflection subscales, and more TAT copies were associated with poorer CVLT-II performance in both total learning and free recall trials. These data demonstrate that the CRHR1 TAT haplotype is associated with cognitive features of depression including difficulty with decision-making, higher rumination, and poorer learning and memory. It will be important in future research to identify the specific molecular mechanisms for CRF1 signaling that contribute to depression-related cognitive dysfunction.},

We review the aspects of the response styles theory that have been well-supported, including evidence that rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of experimental studies show positive distractions relieve depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression, including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm. We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation strategies. Finally, we highlight recent research on the distinction between rumination and more adaptive forms of self-reflection, on basic cognitive deficits or biases in rumination, on its neural and genetic correlates, and on possible interventions to combat rumination.},

During an experimental session, the subjects (70 university students) (1) performed a closed-system thinking task that posed high demands on attention and working memory, (2) rated the task and their state on a set of scales and (3) rated their tolerance for mental effort (task stress) by means of a new 40-item questionnaire (METQ, Mental Effort Tolerance Questionnaire). Steps (1) and (2) were carried out both in quiet and in noise. A factor analysis of the METQ yielded one major factor. It was shown to have high split-half reliability, homogeneity and concurrent validity, the correlation between METQ and performance in the quiet condition being highly significant. The correlation was lower in noise and there was also a low correlation between METQ and self-rated tolerance for noise, which indicates a relative independence of tolerance for each of the two types of stress. The pattern of correlations between METQ and ratings of task-related variables appears to corroborate the validity of the METQ. Here, too, the magnitude of the correlations were higher in quiet than in noise. Finally, METQ displayed a significant negative correlation with EPI neuroticism, while there was no relationship between METQ and EPI extraversion.},

A maximum likelihood factor analysis indicated that self-reported use of a cogitative information-oriented style loaded on two factors. One was marked by information-seeking variables, the other by self-reflective tendencies. A normative style loaded negatively on a bipolarfactor defined by openness to values and actions, suggesting that norm-oriented itndividuals tend to protect themselves from potentially dissonant experience and information. Reported use of a diffuse/avoidant style was associated with a heightened emphasis on a social identity, indicating a reliance on immediate social reinforcements. Results are discussed in terms of a process model of identity formation.},

The results of a principal component analysis on data collected from these binge-watchers demonstrate that individuals perceive binge-watching as a means to satisfy their desires for enjoyment, efficiency, control, and fandom. In addition, individuals are especially drawn to binge-watching when the activity is recommended by others. Subsequent regression and moderation analyses reveal that sensation seeking and need for cognition not only have positive effects on binge-watching behavior but also boost the effects of certain binge-watching motivations. In sum, this study provides an empirical overview of why individuals are motivated to binge-watch TV dramas and how those with certain psychological traits are more likely to engage in this media-consumption behavior.},

When controlling for a variety of health risk factors (viz., age, sex, body mass, exercise, smoking, salt, alcohol, and caffeine), only CHLC remained significant in the physical health models. Results support the cognitive model of mental health which emphasize the importance of adaptive beliefs. Specifically, they suggest that issues about control are related to negative affect and indicate that the often-cited relationship of an external locus of control to depression and anxiety also holds for hostility. The findings do not, however, support the view that anxiety and depression are associated with different types of external locus of control but rather suggest a unified set of locus of control beliefs underlying the three types of negative affect. In addition, evidence is provided for the external validity of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) Scales with respect to mental health. Further, the results indicate that belief about one's health may play a significant role in one's physical health and that the health behavior model of the relationship between locus of control and physical health is insufficient to explain the relationship. As the Chance and Powerful Others MHLC scales were not related to health habits in this sample but were related to mental health (viz., depression, anxiety, and hostility), locus of control beliefs may be related to physical health via their relationship with mental health.},

Diagnoses and age of onset for each of 17 DSM-IV disorders were assessed through retrospective self-report with the fully structured WHO Composite International Diagnostic Instrument (CIDI). Survival analysis was used to examine the associations between early-onset DSM-IV/CIDI disorders and subsequent termination of schooling with controls for socio-demographic characteristics and childhood adversities (i.e. childhood traumatic events, childhood neglect, parental mental illness, family disruption, and low parental educational attainment). Mental disorders were found to be significantly associated with termination of schooling prior to completion of each of four educational milestones (primary school graduation, high school graduation, college entry, college graduation), with odds ratios in the range of 1.3-7.0. The proportion of school terminations attributable to mental disorders was largest for high school graduation (10.2\%) but also meaningful for primary school graduation (3.8\%), college entry (4.4\%) and college graduation (2.6\%).

However, there are no existing prospective studies of this association in adolescents, the onset period of most disorders, limiting inferences regarding possible causal relationships. Methods: In this study, 3040 Australian adolescents, aged 11-18 years at baseline, were measured in 2005-6 and 2007-8. Information on diet and mental health was collected by self-report and anthropometric data by trained researchers. Results: There were cross-sectional, dose response relationships identified between measures of both healthy (positive) and unhealthy (inverse) diets and scores on the emotional subscale of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), where higher scores mean better mental health, before and after adjustments for age, gender, socio-economic status, dieting behaviours, body mass index and physical activity. Higher healthy diet scores at baseline also predicted higher PedsQL scores at follow-up, while higher unhealthy diet scores at baseline predicted lower PedsQL scores at follow-up. Improvements in diet quality were mirrored by improvements in mental health over the follow-up period, while deteriorating diet quality was associated with poorer psychological functioning. Finally, results did not support the reverse causality hypothesis. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of diet in adolescence and its potential role in modifying mental health over the life course. Given that the majority of common mental health problems first manifest in adolescence, intervention studies are now required to test the effectiveness of preventing the common mental disorders through dietary modification.},

FVI was assessed based on frequency of consumption. The primary outcome was a major depressive episode over the previous 12 months. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, household income, education, physical activity, chronic illness and smoking. Results. In the first wave, greater FVI was significantly associated with lower odds of depression (OR: 0.85 95\% CI:0.78-0.92). A combined estimate of all 5 waves demonstrated similar results (OR: 0.72; 95\% CI: 0.71-0.75). Relative to those with the lowest FVI, those with the greatest FVI also had significantly lower odds of suffering from distress (OR: 0.87 95\% CI: 0.78-0.98). These results were consistent across other waves. Perceived poor mental health status and previous diagnosis of a mood disorder and anxiety disorder also demonstrated statistically significant inverse associations with FVI (all p{\textless}0.05). Conclusion. These findings suggest a potentially important role of a healthy diet in the prevention of depression and anxiety. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Modest negative associations between need for cognition and measures of public self-consciousness and social anxiety were also uncovered. Need for cognition scores were generally unrelated to measures of feminine and androgynous sex role attitudes, shyness, sociability, and loneliness.

More recent work has reexamined this assumption (Thompson, Zanna, \& Griffin, in press). The present article details two studies that continue to investigate this notion, examining antecedent variables assumed important in the genesis of attitudinal ambivalence. The first study focuses upon personality-based factors such as individuals' Need for Cognition (NFC) and Personal Fear of Invalidity (PFI) (a heightened concern with error). The pattern of results was consistent with our predictions: High NFC was associated with less ambivalence and high PFI was associated with greater ambivalence. The second study investigated a domain-specific antecedent. It was predicted that higher involvement would reduce the level of ambivalence experienced. Further, involvement was expected to moderate the effect of the personality-based antecedents. Again, results confirmed our hypotheses. High NFC was associated with less ambivalence, especially under conditions of high involvement with the issues. Conversely, high PFI individuals who were highly involved with these issues experienced more ambivalence. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for attitude theory.},

Self-reported levels of BAS and BIS were examined in 62 depressed participants and 27 nondepressed controls. Clinical functioning was assessed at intake and at 8-month follow-up. Relative to nondepressed controls, depressed participants reported lower BAS levels and higher BIS levels. Within the depressed group, lower BAS levels were associated with greater concurrent depression severity and predicted worse-8-month outcome. Levels of both BIS and BAS showed considerable stability over time and clinical state. Overall, results suggest that BAS dysregulation exacerbates the presentation and course of depressive illness.},

  abstract = {In two studies, we examined depressed and nondepressed persons' judgments of the probability of future positive and negative life events occurring to themselves and to others. Study 1 demonstrated that depressed subjects were generally less optimistic than their nondepressed counterparts: Although nondepressed subjects rated positive events as more likely to happen to themselves than negative events, depressed subjects did not. In addition, relative to nondepressed subjects, depressed subjects rated positive events as less likely to occur to themselves and more likely to occur to others and negative events as more likely to occur to both self and others. Study 2 investigated the role that differential levels of self-focused attention might play in mediating these differences. On the basis of prior findings that depressed persons generally engage in higher levels of self-focus than nondepressed persons do and the notion that self-focus activates one's self-schema, we hypothesized that inducing depressed subjects to focus externally would attenuate their pessimistic tendencies. Data from Study 2 supported the hypothesis that high levels of self-focus partially mediate depressive pessimism: Whereas self-focused depressed subjects were more pessimistic than nondepressed subjects, externally focused depressed subjects were not. The role of attentional focus in maintaining these and other depressive pessimistic tendencies was discussed.},

To date, few studies have examined these associations in National Guard service members, where frequency of mental health problems is high, social support may come from military as well as other sources, and services use may be suboptimal. Surveys were administered to 1448 recently returned National Guard members. Multivariable regression models assessed the associations between social support characteristics, probable mental health conditions, and service utilization. In bivariate analyses, large social network size, high social network diversity, high perceived social support, and high military unit support were each associated with lower likelihood of having a probable mental health condition (p {\textless} .001). In adjusted analyses, high perceived social support (OR .90, CI .88-.92) and high unit support (OR .96, CI .94-.97) continued to be significantly associated with lower likelihood of mental health conditions. Two social support measures were associated with lower likelihood of receiving mental health services in bivariate analyses, but were not significant in adjusted models. General social support and military-specific support were robustly associated with reduced mental health symptoms in National Guard members. Policy makers, military leaders, and clinicians should attend to service members' level of support from both the community and their units and continue efforts to bolster these supports. Other strategies, such as focused outreach, may be needed to bring National Guard members with need into mental health care.},

In this study, smokers at public events read brochures containing brief gain- or loss-framed smoking-cessation messages. The influence of framing was moderated by participants' need for cognition (NFC). Individuals lower in NFC had greater intention to quit after reading a gain-framed message than after reading a loss-framed message-a finding consistent with our predictions-whereas framing did not affect the persuasiveness of messages among people higher in NFC.},

After measuring their need for cognition, participants read a high versus low threat message about breast cancer, followed by a persuasive message that recommended breast self-examination. Interaction effects between need for cognition and threat on measures of precautionary motivation supported our main hypothesis that fear appeals only result in adaptive coping (i.e., danger control) among respondents who are high in need for cognition. If possible, persuasive communicators may thus consider screening participants first on their need for cognition. On the other hand, predicted main effects of threat information on maladaptive coping (i.e., fear control) suggest that fear appeals should be used with caution, preceded by extensive pilot testing.},

The literature has been mixed as to how the alternative framing of information in positive or negative terms affects judgments and decisions. We argue that this is because different studies have employed different operational definitions of framing and thus have tapped different underlying processes. We develop a typology to distinguish between three different kinds of valence framing effects. First we discuss the standard risky choice framing effect introduced by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) to illustrate how valence affects willingness to take a risk. Then we discuss attribute framing, which affects the evaluation of object or event characteristics, and goal framing, which affects the persuasiveness of a communication. We describe the distinctions, provide a number of examples of each type, and discuss likely theoretical mechanisms underlying each type of framing effect. Our typology helps explain and resolve apparent confusions in the literature, ties together studies with common underlying mechanisms, and serves as a guide to future research and theory development. We conclude that a broader perspective, focused on the cognitive and motivational consequences of valence-based encoding, opens the door to a deeper understanding of the causes and consequences of framing effects.

All studies were content coded for study descriptors, participant characteristics, and intervention components. We derived weighted mean effect sizes for alcohol interventions versus comparison conditions for consumption variables and alcohol-related problems, over four measurement intervals. Over follow-up intervals lasting up to 6 months, participants in risk reduction interventions drank significantly less relative to controls. Students receiving interventions also reported fewer alcohol-related problems over longer intervals. Moderator analyses suggest that individual, face-to-face interventions using motivational interviewing and personalized normative feedback predict greater reductions in alcohol-related problems. Implications for future research include attention to maintenance of effects, and developing more efficacious interventions for at-risk college drinkers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The health locus of control theory is used to assess adherence to diabetes regimen in some studies in developed countries. The primary purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine the status of diabetes locus of control in a sample of diabetic patients in Iran as a developing country. We investigated selected factors contributing to locus of control and adherence to diabetes regimen. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 120 patients referred to Yazd Diabetes Research Center. The Iranian versions of Diabetes Locus of Control scale and Diabetes Self-care Activities scale were used for data collection. Results: Men revealed more internal locus of control and women revealed more chance locus of control. The attributions of external locus of control increased by age, while the internal locus of control increased by education level and chance locus of control decreased by education level. A positive association between internal locus of control and adherence to diabetes regimen was found and there was a negative association between chance locus of control and adherence to diabetes regimen. Conclusion: Findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving internal locus of control may improve adherence to diabetes regimen but different diabetic patients have different attribution styles and interventional programs to enhance diabetes self-care will be more successful if patients locus of control is addressed.},

The effects of the risk factors depended on children’s level of effortful control. For children lower in effortful control, socioeconomic risk was related to significantly higher initial levels of internalizing and externalizing problems and decreases over time. However, children lower in effortful control had higher levels of problems at all three time points than children higher in effortful control. Maternal risk was associated with increases in internalizing for children lower in effortful control, and environmental risk was related to increases in internalizing and externalizing problems for children lower in effortful control, but not those higher in effortful control. Children who were lower in effortful control appeared to experience more adverse effects of contextual risk than those higher in effortful control, suggesting that interventions aimed at improving children’s effortful control might serve to protect children from increased risk of adjustment problems associated with contextual risk factors.},

The data suggest that (a) NFC involves intrinsic motivation for effortful cognitive processing, (b) NFC may predict such processing mainly in contexts with minimal extrinsic incentives for processing, and (c) control motivation may be related causally both to extrinsic undermining effects and to individual differences in NFC.},

Using a manipulation paradigm, the relationship between control appraisals and other OCD-relevant constructs (threat, responsibility) was examined. As in the non-clinical study, desire for control was moderately affected by responsibility and threat manipulations, while sense of control was not affected by these manipulations. Individuals with OCD recorded higher desire for control and lower sense of control relative to community controls, and a higher desire for control than the anxiety group, suggesting some specificity to OCD. A possible interactive model of control, threat and responsibility is discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract   = {Psychological control has been hypothesized to play a pivotal role in the variability, natural course, and treatment Of anorexia nervosa (AN). However both the empirical and theoretical literatures suggest that this relationship is incompletely understood. Employing a multidimensional control inventory to overcome problems identified in previous research, this study examines the relationship between psychological sense of control and clinical variability of AN in 51 women. An adverse overall sense of control, along with reliance on specific means of gaining control was associated with more severe eating disturbance. Greater use Of a negative-assertive style of gaining control was associated with a longer time since first diagnosis, while desire for control was significantly associated with menstrual status. Finally, self-induced vomiting was associated with specific means of obtaining control, while use of laxatives was associated with reduced control in the domain of body. Such findings have implications for future research and the application of control constructs in treatment. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.},

However, the high desire for control subjects ended more conversations than did lows. In Experiment 3, “get-acquainted” conversations between two high desire for control subjects were characterized by an increase in interruptions and more episodes of simultaneous talking than when one high and one low desire for control subject interacted. Contrary to expectation, a large number of interruptions and simultaneous talking episodes also characterized the conversations between two low desire for control subjects.

Forty-eight dental phobics were given an initial assessment and avoidance behavior was determined by the degree of observance of three subsequent dental appointments. Principal component analysis revealed separate factors for trait and phobic anxiety as well as for avoidance and dysfunctional cognitions. Women showed a higher degree of avoidance than men. Regression analysis revealed a high desire for control over dental treatment combined with a low level of perceived control as the only significant predictor variable of avoidance. The results suggest that avoidance behavior in dental phobia could be reduced by extending patients' control over treatment conditions.},

This research (across eight samples) indicates that low perceived control is associated with heightened stressful responding before and during dental treatment only among patients reporting high desire for control. Thus, the impact of low perceived control appears to be moderated by desire for control. An additional finding is that manipulations of control (eg., providing information, stress inoculation training) primarily impact patients reporting both a high desire for control (during treatment) and low initial perceived control. These data suggest that consideration of patients' desire for control in addition to their perceived control increases our ability to predict their level of dental stress. Additionally, these data provide initial support for the view that the discrepancy between high desire for control and low perceived control play a causal role in patient's perceptions of dental pain and fear.},

These measures were readministered to 523 of these subjects approximately seven weeks later. Confirmatory factor analysis of the data indicated that desire for healthcare control is best conceptualized as having three separate components. Desire for information was clearly unrelated to either desire for behavioral or decisional control; however the latter two forms of control, which are indicative of more active engagement by the individual, overlapped to a moderate degree. The three-factor model was stable over time and the component factors (particularly desire for decisional and behavioral control) were also stable. No strong relationships were found between the component factors and measures of health locus of control or the basic personality trait dimensions measured by the NEO, suggesting that the factors represent largely situation-specific traits. Findings were discussed in terms of how they may have been influenced by variability in the instruments that were used to measure the separate desire for healthcare control components, and in terms of the need for criterion-related validational work especially in the. crucial area of decisional control.},

  abstract   = {In view of a growing number of different psychosocial cardiovascular risk profiles which have been developed and tested over the past 30 years, it is now timely to assess their interrelationship in terms of convergent validity and differential predictive power. Three such profiles, ‘chronic workload’, ‘need for control’ and ‘vital exhaustion’, are analysed using data from a case-control study of 79 hospitalized male patients following a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (mean age 52.9) and of 132 controls hospitalized for surgical (mean age 52.0). As predicted by theory, all three concepts significantly discriminated between AMI patients and controls both in univariate analyses and after adjusting for important confounders (age, anginal pain, cigarette smoking). However, when controlling for ‘vital exhaustion’ (OR=3.80, p=0.02), the effect of the critical factor ‘immersion’ of the concept ‘need for control’ lost its statistical significance (OR=2.11, p=0.24), whereas the powerful independent effect of ‘chronic workload’ (OR=8.98, p=0.01) was maintained. No interaction effects on the criterion produced by the three concepts were observed. The data confirm the validity of selected elements of the effort–reward imbalance model and contribute to the specification of the coronary-prone coping career. Therefore, they encourage more intense comparative testing of related concepts in research on psychosocial cardiovascular risk profiles. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) cause a high burden of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Age, race, and ethnicity are important risk factors for ADRD.
Methods
We estimated the future US burden of ADRD by age, sex, and race and ethnicity by applying subgroup-specific prevalence among Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries aged ≥65 years in 2014 to subgroup-specific population estimates for 2014 and population projection data from the US Census Bureau for 2015 to 2060.
Results
The burden of ADRD in 2014 was an estimated 5.0 million adults aged ≥65 years or 1.6\% of the population, and there are significant disparities in ADRD prevalence among population subgroups defined by race and ethnicity. ADRD burden will double to 3.3\% by 2060 when 13.9 million Americans are projected to have the disease.
Discussion
These estimates can be used to guide planning and interventions related to caring for the ADRD population and supporting caregivers.},

Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, exerts prolongevity effects in evolutionarily diverse species. However, its impact on the intestinal homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that rapamycin can slow down the proliferation rate of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the aging guts and induce autophagy in the intestinal epithelium in Drosophila. Rapamycin can also significantly affect the FOXO associated genes in intestine and up-regulate the negative regulators of IMD/Rel pathway, consequently delaying the microbial expansion in the aging guts. Collectively, these findings reveal that rapamycin can delay the intestinal aging by inhibiting mTOR and thus keeping stem cell proliferation in check. These results will further explain the mechanism of healthspan and lifespan extension by rapamycin in Drosophila.},

  abstract = {How do we recognize people that are familiar to us? There is overwhelming evidence that our brains process voice and face in a combined fashion to optimally recognize both who is speaking and what is said. Surprisingly, this combined processing of voice and face seems to occur even if one stream of information is missing. For example, if subjects only hear someone who is familiar to them talking, without seeing their face, visual face-processing areas are active. One reason for this crossmodal activation might be that it is instrumental for early sensory processing of voices—a hypothesis that is contrary to current models of unisensory perception. Here, we test this hypothesis by harnessing a temporally highly resolved method, i.e., magnetoencephalography (MEG), to identify the temporal response profile of the fusiform face area in response to auditory-only voice recognition. Participants briefly learned a set of voices audio-visually, i.e., together with a talking face. After learning, we measured subjects' MEG signals in response to the auditory-only, now familiar, voices. The results revealed three key mechanisms that characterize the sensory processing of familiar speakers' voices: (i) activation in the face-sensitive fusiform gyrus at very early auditory processing stages, i.e., only 100ms after auditory onset, (ii) a temporal facilitation of auditory processing (M200), and (iii) a correlation of this temporal facilitation with recognition performance. These findings suggest that a neural representation of face information is evoked before the identity of the voice is even recognized and that the brain uses this visual representation to facilitate early sensory processing of auditory-only voices.},

  abstract = {The goal of the current paper is to review recent findings concerning the neural basis of congenital prosopagnosia (CP), a lifelong impairment in face processing that occurs in the absence of explicit brain damage. As such, CP offers a unique model for exploring the psychological and neural bases of normal face processing. We start by providing background about face perception and representation, and then review behavioral evidence gleaned from individuals with CP. We then review recent functional and structural neural investigations which offer a comprehensive account of the mechanisms underlying CP and support a characterization of this impairment as a disconnection syndrome rather than as a syndrome related to focal brain malfunction. We end the paper by offering a general framework for CP which, we believe, best integrates the behavioral and neural findings, and offers a platform for generating hypotheses for future studies. There remain many open issues in our understanding of CP and, to address these unanswered questions, we lay out several future research directions and testable hypotheses for further investigation.},

Many individuals with congenital prosopagnosia-an impairment in face processing-exhibit normal blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation in the core VOTC regions. These individuals evince a reduction in the structural integrity of the white matter tracts connecting VOTC to anterior temporal and frontal cortices, part of the "extended" face network. The impairment in congenital prosopagnosia may arise, therefore, not from a dysfunction of the core VOTC areas but from a failure to propagate signals between the intact VOTC and the extended nodes of the network. Using the fMR adaptation paradigm with famous and unknown faces, we show that individuals with congenital prosopagnosia evince normal adaptation effects in VOTC, indicating sensitivity to facial identity, but show no differential activation for familiar versus unknown faces outside VOTC, particularly in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior paracingulate cortex. Normal BOLD activation in VOTC is thus insufficient to subserve intact face recognition, and disrupted information propagation between VOTC and the extended face processing network may explain the functional impairment in congenital prosopagnosia.},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we first uncover largely normal activation patterns in the posterior core face patches in CP. We also document normal activity of the amygdala (emotion processing) as well as normal or even enhanced functional connectivity between the amygdala and the core regions. Critically, in the same individuals, activation of the anterior temporal cortex (identity processing) is reduced and connectivity between this region and the posterior core regions is disrupted. The dissociation between the neural profiles of the anterior temporal lobe and amygdala was evident both during a task-related face scan and during a resting state scan, in the absence of visual stimulation. Taken together, these findings elucidate selective disruptions in neural circuitry in CP and offer an explanation for the known differential difficulty in identity versus emotional expression recognition in many individuals with CP.},

  abstract = {Background
Face recognition is a complex function sustained by a distributed large-scale neural network, with a core system involving the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the splenial commissural fibers. This circuit seems to be bilaterally organized, but with a right hemispheric dominance. According to this anatomic functional model, prosopagnosia is usually, but not exclusively, generated by a damage of the right part of this brain network.
Case Description
This report describes an original case of a multicentric diffuse low-grade glioma, with a right occipitotemporal tumor and a left anterior temporoinsular tumor. Awake surgery for the right occipitotemporal lesion, involving fusiform and inferior occipital gyri and ILF, was achieved in a first step without causing any neurologic deficit. A subsequent resection of the left anterior temporoinsular lesion, with removal of the anterior left ILF, was achieved 1 year later. Surprisingly, the patient experienced a strong and permanent prosopagnosia after this second surgery.
Conclusions
The authors investigate the possible causes resulting in this prosopagnosia. Specifically, they suggest a decompensation within a reorganized neural network after the first operation, because of a disconnection syndrome induced by a bilateral surgical damage of the ventral occipitotemporal structural connectivity. These original data can be useful for neurosurgeons, especially when achieving resection for multicentric tumors involving both ventral streams, to inform patients before surgery about the possible risk of face recognition deficit, and to adapt the cognitive tasks intraoperatively during awake procedure.},

  abstract   = {Face recognition is supported by collaborative work of multiple face-responsive regions in the brain. Based on findings from individuals with normal face recognition ability, a neural model has been proposed with the occipital face area (OFA), fusiform face area (FFA), and face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) as the core face network (CFN) and the rest of the face-responsive regions as the extended face network (EFN). However, little is known about how these regions work collaboratively for face recognition in our daily life. Here we focused on individuals suffering developmental prosopagnosia (DP), a neurodevelopmental disorder specifically impairing face recognition, to shed light on the infrastructure of the neural model of face recognition. Specifically, we used a variant of global brain connectivity method to comprehensively explore resting-state functional connectivity (FC) among face-responsive regions in a large sample of DPs (N = 64). We found that both the FCs within the CFN and those between the CFN and EFN were largely reduced in DP. Importantly, the right OFA and FFA served as the dysconnectivity hubs within the CFN, i.e., FCs concerning these two regions within the CFN were largely disrupted. In addition, DPs' right FFA also showed reduced FCs with the EFN. Moreover, these disrupted FCs were related to DP's behavioral deficit in face recognition, with the FCs from the FFA to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and pSTS the most predictive. Based on these findings, we proposed a revised neural model of face recognition demonstrating the relatedness of interactions among face-responsive regions to face recognition.},

  abstract = {Emotion regulation (ER) is necessary, when type, intensity, or duration of an emotion is not adequate for a specific situation. During emotion regulation, activity in brain regions associated with cognitive control intensifies, and activity in brain regions associated with emotion responding diminishes. Immediately after regulation, activity in the amygdala increases and forms a paradoxical aftereffect. Extensive literature exists describing immediate and short-term neural effects, but only few studies targeted the association between individual differences in personality traits and neural correlates of ER. N = 85 healthy participants completed the NEO Five Factor Inventory and the PANAS scale to measure personality traits and positive and negative affect. An ER task with relaxation period was conducted within the fMRI scanner. Participants should permit their emotions or distance themselves from negative and neutral images. During ER, activation in the prefrontal cortex and deactivation in the left amygdala was found. During the post-regulation period, an immediate paradoxical aftereffect was marginally found in in the amygdala. Personality traits did not predict arousal ratings and neural activity in the amygdala during emotion regulation or post-regulation. To conclude, we replicated typical activation and deactivation patterns during intentional emotion regulation. Depending on the statistical approach, we partially replicated the paradoxical aftereffect in the amygdala. However, there was no association between personality traits and activation in the amygdala.},

  abstract   = {Consistently, moderate to strong correlations between emotion regulation and depressive symptomology are well documented. This relationship is most often conceptualized as unidirectional, in that poor emotion regulation acts as a pre-existing risk factor for depressive symptomatology. However, explicit examinations of the direction of this relationship have been limited, and support for a directional relation between emotion regulation and psychopathology has been inconsistent. Moreover, the majority of the research exploring these associations relies on adult participants and the studies that have examined emotion regulation and depression in adolescents have relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional data. As a replication and extension of work that has been done by others, the current study assessed Suppression and Reappraisal use and Depressive Symptoms in 1343 adolescents (Mean age = 12.9 years, SD = 0.85) who completed assessments of emotion regulation and depressive symptoms four times over two years. Results indicated that only Suppression but not Reappraisal was concurrently correlated with Depressive Symptoms. Moreover, a correlated slopes analysis showed that within-subject changes in use of Suppression, but not Reappraisal, were associated with within-subject changes in Depressive Symptoms over time. Finally, a cross-lag panel analysis showed that while Depressive Symptoms were predictive of future Suppression use, Suppression use did not predict later Depressive Symptoms. Therefore, while Suppression and Depressive Symptoms seem to be associated during adolescence, associations between reappraisal and depressive symptomology were not present in the current study. Moreover, despite previous evidence supporting emotion regulation as a risk factor for depression, suppression may be the outcome, rather than the antecedent, of depressive symptoms during adolescence.},

  abstract   = {Several influential theories posit that improvements in emotion regulation contribute to enhanced emotional well-being in older adulthood. However, surprisingly little is known about whether there are age differences in emotion regulation strategy use. We addressed this question by testing whether older adults report using typically adaptive strategies more often and regulate more flexibly than relatively younger adults. In a two-part study, 136 married couples (N = 272) aged 23-85 years completed individual difference measures of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, and then nine daily reports of a broader range of emotion regulation strategies, now including situation selection, situation modification, and distraction. Older adults reported greater habitual use of suppression, but age did not predict situation selection, situation modification, distraction, or reappraisal. In terms of emotion regulation flexibility, a similar number of strategies were reported on a daily basis regardless of the regulator's age. Unexpectedly, relatively older adults were less variable in their self-reported daily use of each strategy and middle-aged adults were the least variable in their strategy repertoire across different days. These findings counter the common notion that older adults use typically adaptive strategies more than younger adults. Instead, they suggest older adults may be more consistent in their emotion regulation patterns across situations, potentially suggestive of less flexibility. Implications for aging, emotion regulation, and well-being are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record},

In this study, we evaluated adolescents’ and their respective parents’ perspectives about their use of two ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) in daily life. In addition, we evaluated the within-family associations between adolescents’ and their parents’ use of strategies. We controlled for adolescents’ gender and age and the perceived quality of their relationships with their parents (mothers and fathers). The sample consisted of 33 12- to 18-year-old adolescent–father–mother triads, totaling 99 participants. Parents and adolescents reported their use of ER strategies in response to eight random prompts throughout the day, by means of the experience sampling method for 1 week. Participants provided 4082 reports on their momentary experiences. The data were analyzed using multilevel modeling to account for the hierarchical structure of the repeated daily assessments. The significant association between parents’ and adolescents’ use of ER strategies was specific to mother–adolescent dyads. The significant association between adolescents’ and their mothers’ ER strategies varied as a function of the adolescents’ age and the quality of their relationship with their mothers according to adolescents’ reports, but not as a function of adolescent gender. These findings suggest that mothers have a role in their adolescents’ emotion regulation in a developmental period characterized by autonomy from parental guidance.},

The current research examines the roles of age and attention under various emotion regulation instructions. We measured younger (N = 92) and older (N = 88) adults' fixation to negative emotional content and continuously rated affect during normal viewing and instructions to regulate. Those instructed to regulate first did so generally, then using detached or positive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Older adults (OAs) fixated less than younger adults (YAs) in negative areas regardless of instructions, suggesting broad age-related attentional tendencies. In contrast to some previous research, between-subjects analyses showed no age differences in effects of either form of reappraisal or suppression on affect. Within-subject analyses showed specific regulation instructions predicted less negative affect than general instructions for both age groups. Attention was unrelated to affect for both YAs and OAs across instructions. In sum, this research presents pervasive attentional preferences away from negative material in OAs as well as evidence of successful reappraisal and suppression in both age groups. Looking patterns, however, seemed unrelated to emotion regulation instructions' effects on mood for either age group. Age differences in attentional patterns may therefore not translate into age differences in subsequent emotion regulation success.},

The current study examined whether child emotion regulation, specifically, the use of cognitive reappraisal and suppression, moderated the link between parent and child depression. We recruited 458 parents and their children between the ages of 7–11 from the community. The majority of children were Caucasian (74.2\%) and approximately half were girls (46.1\%). Among children with a parent history of MDD, those who reported using cognitive reappraisal more frequently were less likely to have a history of depressive diagnoses themselves and had higher current levels of positive affect. Although children’s use of suppression was not associated with their levels of depressive symptoms among children with a parent history of MDD, higher levels of suppression were related to higher levels of depressive symptoms among children with no parent history of MDD. These findings suggest that, among children with a history of parent depression, children’s use of cognitive reappraisal may influence their own risk for developing depression and highlights the potential utility of early interventions that focus on improving the use of emotion regulation strategies like cognitive reappraisal among children of depressed parents.},

Older adults also demonstrate an attentional preference to avoid, while younger adults show a bias towards approaching negative stimuli. This suggests a possible age-related differentiation of cognitive effort across approach and avoidance of negative stimuli during emotion regulation. In this study we tracked cognitive effort via pupil dilation during the use of distraction (avoidance) and reappraisal (approach) strategies across age. Forty-eight younger adults (M = 20.94, SD= 1.78; 19 male) and 48 older adults (M = 68.82, SD=5.40; 15 male) viewed a slideshow of negative images, and were instructed to distract, reappraise, or passively view each image. Older adults showed greater pupil dilation during reappraisal than distraction, but younger adults displayed no difference between conditions— an effect that survived when controlling for gaze patterns. Gaze findings revealed that older adults looked less within images during active emotion regulation compared to passive viewing (no difference between distraction and reappraisal), and younger adults showed no difference across strategies. Younger adults gazed less within the most emotional image areas during distraction, but this did not significantly contribute to pupil response. Our findings support that distraction is less cognitively effortful than reinterpreting negative information in later-life. These findings could be explained by older adults’ motivational bias to disengage from negative information due to the age-related positivity effect, or compensation for decreased working memory resources across the lifespan.},

Using functional neuroimaging, the present study aimed to analyze the role of working memory capacity (WMC) and cognitive flexibility in brain activity during down-regulation of negative emotions by reappraisal in N = 20 healthy participants. Results suggests that WMC and cognitive flexibility were negatively correlated with prefrontal activity during reappraisal condition. Here, results also revealed a negative correlation between cognitive flexibility and amygdala activation. These findings provide first hints that (1) individuals with lower WMC and lower cognitive flexibility might need more higher-order cognitive neural resources in order to down-regulate negative emotions and (2) cognitive flexibility relates to emotional reactivity during reappraisal.},

We discuss evidence showing that cognitively demanding tasks induce a reorganization between large-scale networks. Specifically, they reduce activation in the amygdala, a key structure of the salience/defensive survival network. The notion that increasing cognitive demand may benefit treatment of fear-related disorders provides a mechanistic account of already existing techniques, such as Tetris, EMDR, and cognitive reappraisal. Future research should reveal whether systematically increasing cognitive demand leads to a stronger reorganization between the central-executive control network and the salience/defensive survival network and thereby a reduction in fear and anxiety-related symptoms.},

  abstract   = {Background
Most neuroimaging studies of adolescent depression employ tasks not designed to engage brain regions necessary for the cognitive control of emotion, which is central to many behavioral therapies for depression. Depressed adults demonstrate less effective activation of these regions and greater amygdala activation during cognitive reappraisal; we examined whether depressed adolescents show similar patterns of brain activation.
Methods
We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during cognitive reappraisal in 41 adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 34 matched controls (ages 13–17). We examined group differences in (1) activations associated with reappraisal and reappraisal success (i.e., negative affect reduction during reappraisal) using whole brain and amygdala region-of-interest analyses, and (2) functional connectivity of regions from the group-by-reappraisal success interaction.
Results
We found no significant group differences in whole brain or amygdala analyses during reappraisal. In the group-by-reappraisal success interaction, activations in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and left dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) were associated with reappraisal success in healthy controls but not depressed adolescents. Depressed adolescents demonstrated reduced connectivity between the left dmPFC and the anterior insula/inferior frontal gyri bilaterally (AI/IFG) and between left dlPFC and left AI/IFG.
Limitations
Our results should be considered exploratory given our less conservative statistical threshold in the group-by-reappraisal interaction.
Conclusions
We find preliminary evidence that depressed adolescents engage cognitive control regions less efficiently than healthy controls, suggesting delayed maturation of regulatory prefrontal cortex regions; more research is needed to determine whether cognitive therapies improve functioning of these regions in depressed youth.},

Use of cognitive reappraisal has been associated with diminished experience of anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as greater overall well-being. Using data from a study of 647 healthy young adults, we provide initial evidence that an association between typical use of cognitive reappraisal in daily life and the experience of anxiety and depressive symptoms is moderated by the microstructural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, which provides a major anatomical link between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Our findings are consistent with the nature of top-down regulation of bottom-up negative emotions and suggest the uncinate fasciculus may be a useful target in the search for biomarkers predicting not only disorder risk but also response to psychotherapy utilizing cognitive reappraisal.},

  abstract = {Sensory information undergoes extensive associative elaboration and attentional modulation as it becomes incorporated into the texture of cognition. This process occurs along a core synaptic hierarchy which includes the primary sensory, upstream unimodal, downstream unimodal, heteromodal, paralimbic and limbic zones of the cerebral cortex. Connections from one zone to another are reciprocal and allow higher synaptic levels to exert a feedback (top-down) influence upon earlier levels of processing. Each cortical area provides a nexus for the convergence of afferents and divergence of efferents. The resultant synaptic organization supports parallel as well as serial processing, and allows each sensory event to initiate multiple cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Upstream sectors of unimodal association areas encode basic features of sensation such as colour, motion, form and pitch. More complex contents of sensory experience such as objects, faces, word-forms, spatial locations and sound sequences become encoded within downstream sectors of unimodal areas by groups of coarsely tuned neurons. The highest synaptic levels of sensory-fugal processing are occupied by heteromodal, paralimbic and limbic cortices, collectively known as transmodal areas. The unique role of these areas is to bind multiple unimodal and other transmodal areas into distributed but integrated multimodal representations. Transmodal areas in the midtemporal cortex, Wernicke's area, the hippocampalentorhinal complex and the posterior parietal cortex provide critical gateways for transforming perception into recognition, word-forms into meaning, scenes and events into experiences, and spatial locations into targets for exploration. All cognitive processes arise from analogous associative transformations of similar sets of sensory inputs. The differences in the resultant cognitive operation are determined by the anatomical and physiological properties of the transmodal node that acts as the critical gateway for the dominant transformation. Interconnected sets of transmodal nodes provide anatomical and computational epicentres for large-scale neurocognitive networks. In keeping with the principles of selectively distributed processing, each epicentre of a large-scale network displays a relative specialization for a specific behavioural component of its principal neurospychological domain. The destruction of transmodal epicentres causes global impairments such as multimodal anemia, neglect and amnesia, whereas their selective disconnection from relevant unimodal areas elicits modality-specific impairments such as prosopagnosia, pure word blindness and category-specific anemias. The human brain contains at least five anatomically distinct networks. The network for spatial awareness is based on transmodal epicentres in the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal eye fields; the language network on epicentres in Wernicke's and Broca's areas; the explicit memory/emotion network on epicentres in the hippocampal-entorhinal complex and the amygdala; the face-object recognition network on epicentres in the midtemporal and temporopolar cortices; and the working memory-executive function network on epicentres in the lateral prefrontal cortex and perhaps the posterior parietal cortex. Individual sensory modalities give rise to streams of processing directed to transmodal nodes belonging to each of these networks. The fidelity of sensory channels is actively protected through approximately four synaptic levels of sensory-fugal processing. The modality-specific cortices at these four synaptic levels encode the most veridical representations of experience. Attentional, motivational and emotional modulations, including those related to working memory, novelty-seeking and mental imagery, become increasingly more pronounced within downstream components of unimodal areas, where they help to create a highly edited subjective version of the world. The prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in these attentional and emotional modulations and allows neural responses to reflect the significance rather than the surface properties of sensory events. Additional modulatory influences are exerted by the cholinergic and monoaminergic pathways of the ascending reticular activating system. Working memory, one of the most prominent manifestations of prefrontal cortex activity, prolongs the neural impact of environmental and mental events in a way that enriches the texture of consciousness. The synaptic architecture of large-scale networks and the manifestations of working memory, novelty-seeking behaviours and mental imagery collectively help to loosen the rigid stimulus-response bonds that dominate the behaviour of lower animal species. This phylogenetic trend has helped to shape the unique properties of human consciousness and to induce the emergence of second-order (symbolic) representations related to language. Through the advent of language and the resultant ability to communicate abstract concepts, the critical pacemaker for human cognitive development has shifted from the extremely slow process of structural brain evolution to the much more rapid one of distributed computations where each individual intelligence can become incorporated into an interactive lattice that promotes the transgenerational transfer and accumulation of knowledge.},

Multiple regression analyses identified rumination and suppression to be associated with more work-related stress and stress-related symptoms. Acceptance was linked to fewer symptoms and, rather unexpectedly, avoidance was linked to less work-related stress. No effects were observed for reappraisal and problem solving. Our findings confirm the dysfunctional role of rumination and suppression for the mental and physical health of high-risk populations and advance the debate on the context-specific efficacy of emotion regulation strategies.},

How a single brain lesion could cause such a complex disorder is unclear, leading many to speculate that concurrent delirium, psychiatric disease, dementia, or a second lesion is required. Here we instead propose that Capgras and other delusional misidentification syndromes arise from single lesions at unique locations within the human brain connectome. This hypothesis is motivated by evidence that symptoms emerge from sites functionally connected to a lesion location, not just the lesion location itself. First, 17 cases of lesion-induced delusional misidentifications were identified and lesion locations were mapped to a common brain atlas. Second, lesion network mapping was used to identify brain regions functionally connected to the lesion locations. Third, regions involved in familiarity perception and belief evaluation, two processes thought to be abnormal in delusional misidentifications, were identified using meta-analyses of previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. We found that all 17 lesion locations were functionally connected to the left retrosplenial cortex, the region most activated in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of familiarity. Similarly, 16 of 17 lesion locations were functionally connected to the right frontal cortex, the region most activated in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of expectation violation, a component of belief evaluation. This connectivity pattern was highly specific for delusional misidentifications compared to four other lesion-induced neurological syndromes (P {\textless} 0.0001). Finally, 15 lesions causing other types of delusions were connected to expectation violation (P {\textless} 0.0001) but not familiarity regions, demonstrating specificity for delusion content. Our results provide potential neuroanatomical correlates for impaired familiarity perception and belief evaluation in patients with delusional misidentifications. More generally, we demonstrate a mechanism by which a single lesion can cause a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome based on that lesion's unique pattern of functional connectivity, without the need for pre-existing or hidden pathology.},

  abstract   = {In recent years, an explosion of neuroimaging studies has examined cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing the way one thinks about a stimulus in order to change its affective impact. Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala, but they offer competing visions of how this is accomplished. One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala, whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC, and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions. This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus, and these altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala.},

Capgras syndrome is thought to be a rare syndrome which commonly occurs in a psychotic context.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the 5-year prevalence rate of CS in a university hospital in-patient setting and determine associated etiological and sociodemographic factors.
METHODS: All patient files and medical records were reviewed in detail for the presence of Capgras syndrome. The sociodemographic variables, clinical manifestations, and psychiatric and medical diagnoses of patients who fulfilled clinical criteria for Capgras syndrome were recorded for statistical evaluation.
RESULTS: The retrospective evaluation of patient files in 920 cases admitted to our psychiatric in-patient unit over 5 years revealed that 12 patients fulfilled the criteria for Capgras syndrome. The crude prevalence of Capgras syndrome in this population during 5-year period was 1.3\% (1.8\% for females, 0.9\% for males). Schizophrenia (50\%) was the most common psychiatric diagnosis in these patients. Only two patients presented with an organic etiology underlying Capgras syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that Capgras syndrome is not a rare syndrome, and commonly occurs during the course of either functional or organic psychotic illness. Age seems to be an important predicting factor for the etiology of psychosis underlying Capgras syndrome.},

Salivary cortisol was measured at baseline and at regular intervals across a 5 h testing period. Following dosing, state-aggressive behavior was measured by a laboratory task, the Point-Subtraction Aggression Paradigm. History of child abuse/neglect, psychopathy, impulsivity, and a trait measure of aggression were assessed through self-report questionnaires.ResultsUsing multiple regression, a model including abuse/neglect, psychopathy, impulsivity, and baseline cortisol explained 58 \% of the variance in trait aggression and 26 \% of the variance in state aggression. Abuse/neglect predicted diminished HPA-axis reactivity and HPA-axis reactivity showed a trend toward predicting state and trait aggression, although it was not a significant mediating variable between abuse/neglect and aggression.ConclusionsThe results indicate that child maltreatment, psychopathy and HPA-axis reactivity interact to provide a confluence over aggressive behavior, and intervention efforts need to consider all these factors.},

The results of the conducted study (N = 226) indicated that there were weaker relations between various features of identity structure and subjective well-being for individuals with a highly interdependent self-construal than for those with a highly independent self-construal. The results also showed that specificity, separateness, and stability of identity content influenced positive and negative affect through the mediating agency of independent and interdependent self-construals.

In contrast, stressors were negatively related among men who were low in both and were unrelated among women regardless of their coping or expectancies.

The Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) was developed for the measurement of Novelty Seeking (NS), Harm Avoidance (HA) and Reward Dependence (RD). In this study reliability and construct validity of a German translation of the TPQ were investigated in a sample of 160 subjects. The internal consistencies of the superscales NS, HA and RD were high. The small intercorrelations of the TPQ superscales and the factorial structure of the twelve TPQ subscales yielded some support for Cloninger's personality theory. NS seems to tap an impulsivity factor because of strong correlations with Psychoticism, Extraversion, Impulsiveness and Sensation Seeking. HA correlates with Neuroticism and Introversion and appears to measure a neuroticism or behavioral inhibition factor. RD, however, showed only marginal associations with other variables. In general, results for the German version indicate, with exception for the RD scales, sufficient psychometric properties.},

We sought to address this question among 131 treatment-seeking smokers who were randomly assigned to either a smoking cessation treatment (four 30-min behavioral counseling sessions) or a control condition. We found that HA was positively associated with baseline depressive symptoms, baseline negative affect, and post-quit withdrawal, and negatively associated with positive affect at both baseline and post-quit. Additionally, we found that smokers with higher HA scores were more likely to be abstinent. NS was negatively associated with post-quit positive affect and positively associated with post-quit negative affect and withdrawal. RD was not found to be related to any outcome measures. Our findings suggest that, despite experiencing greater baseline and post-quit negative affect, smokers higher in trait harm avoidance are more likely to quit smoking.

The protective function of coping behavior can be exercised in three ways: by eliminating or modifying conditions giving rise to problems; by perceptually controlling the meaning of experience in a manner that neutralizes its problematic character; and by keeping the emotional consequences of problems within manageable bounds. The efficacy of a number of concrete coping behaviors representing these three functions was evaluated. Results indicate that individuals' coping interventions are most effective when dealing with problems within the close interpersonal role areas of marriage and child-rearing and least effective when dealing with the more impersonal problems found in occupation. The effective coping modes are unequally distributed in society, with men, the educated, and the affluent making greater use of the efficacious mechanisms.},

So far, NFC has been assessed via self-report. More recent research, however, accentuates the value of indirect measures, as they tap into implicit aspects of the personality self-concept and are assumed to provide incremental validity especially in predicting automatic aspects of behaviour. Therefore, in the present research, different NFC-Implicit Association Tests (IATs) were developed and pretested for psychometric properties. The final version was systematically tested for its predictive validity over and above the direct NFC measure based on a latent variable approach. The results provide evidence for a double dissociation model and suggest the NFC-IAT to exert its predictive value regarding the more spontaneous aspects of NFC-related behaviour, whereas the NFC scale was rather predictive for the more reflective aspects of behaviour. Moreover, the present research contributes to the understanding of construct-unrelated variance in personality IATs and offers valuable information for test development in the realm of personality IATs.},

The instructions preceding the task set the participants' expectations regarding task difficulty. An interaction between expectation and need for cognition indicated that participants with low need for cognition performed worse when they expected difficult problems.

  abstract   = {The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). This method involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.},

  abstract  = {Oxytocin is a key modulator of social interaction, but we possess little knowledge of its underlying effects on neuropsychological processes. We used a spatio-temporal EEG microstates analysis to reveal oxytocin’s effects on the temporal dynamics of intrinsically generated activity in neural networks. Given oxytocin’s known anxiolytic effects, we hypothesized that it increases the temporal stability of the four archetypal EEG resting networks. Eighty-six male participants had received oxytocin or placebo intranasally before we recorded their resting EEG. As hypothesized, oxytocin globally increased the average duration of the four archetypal resting networks and specifically decreased the occurrence and coverage of an autonomic processing-related network to benefit greater coverage of an attention-related network. Moreover, these neurophysiological changes were more pronounced in participants with high anxiety levels and strong subjectively experienced effects of the oxytocin administration. In sum, our study shows that oxytocin reduces rapid switching among neural resting networks by increasing their temporal stability. Specifically, it seems to reduce the brain’s need for preparing the internally-oriented processing of autonomic information, thus enabling the externally-oriented processing of social information. Changes in the temporal dynamics of resting networks might underlie oxytocin’s anxiolytic effects - potentially informing innovative psychobiological treatment strategies.},

  abstract   = {Objectives: Although behavioral studies have demonstrated that normative affective traits modulate the processing of facial and emotionally charged stimuli, direct electrophysiological evidence for this modulation is still lacking. Methods: Event-related potential (ERP) data associated with personal, traitlike approach- or withdrawal-related attitude (assessed post-recording and 14 months later) were investigated in 18 subjects during task-free (i.e. unrequested, spontaneous) emotional evaluation of faces. Temporal and spatial aspects of 27 channel ERP were analyzed with microstate analysis and low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), a new method to compute 3 dimensional cortical current density implemented in the Talairach brain atlas. Results: Microstate analysis showed group differences 132-196 and 196-272 ms poststimulus, with right-shifted electric gravity centers for subjects with negative affective attitude. During these (over subjects reliably identifiable) personality-modulated, face-elicited microstates, LORETA revealed activation of bilateral occipito-temporal regions, reportedly associated with facial configuration extraction processes. Negative compared to positive affective attitude showed higher activity right temporal; positive compared to negative attitude showed higher activity left temporo-parieto-occipital. Conclusions: These temporal and spatial aspects suggest that the subject groups differed in brain activity at early, automatic, stimulus-related face processing steps when structural face encoding (configuration extraction) occurs. In sum, the brain functional microstates associated with affect-related personality features modulate brain mechanisms during face processing already at early information processing stages.},

  abstract = {Human brain electric activity can be measured at high temporal and fairly good spatial resolution via electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG microstate analysis is an increasingly popular method used to investigate this activity at a millisecond resolution by segmenting it into quasi-stable states of approximately 100 ms duration. These so-called EEG microstates were postulated to represent atoms of thoughts and emotions and can be classified into four classes of topographies A through D, which explain up to 90\% of the variance of continuous EEG. The present study investigated whether these topographies are primarily driven by alpha activity originating from the posterior cingulate cortex (all topographies), left and right posterior cortices, and the anterior cingulate cortex (topographies A, B, and C, respectively). We analyzed two 64-channel resting state EEG datasets (N = 61 and N = 78) of healthy participants. Sources of head-surface signals were determined via exact low resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). The Hilbert transformation was applied to identify instantaneous source strength of four EEG frequency bands (delta through beta). These source strength values were averaged for each participant across time periods belonging to a particular microstate. For each dataset, these averages of the different microstate classes were compared for each voxel. Consistent differences across datasets were identified via a conjunction analysis. The intracortical strength and spatial distribution of alpha band activity mainly determined whether a head-surface topography of EEG microstate class A, B, C, or D was induced. EEG microstate class C was characterized by stronger alpha activity compared to all other classes in large portions of the cortex. Class A was associated with stronger left posterior alpha activity than classes B and D, and class B was associated with stronger right posterior alpha activity than A and D. Previous results indicated that EEG microstate dynamics reflect a fundamental mechanism of the human brain that is altered in different mental states in health and disease. They are characterized by systematic transitions between four head-surface topographies, the EEG microstate classes. Our results show that intra-cortical alpha oscillations, which likely reflect decreased cortical excitability, primarily account for the emergence of these classes. We suggest that microstate class dynamics reflect transitions between four global attractor states that are characterized by selective inhibition of specific intra-cortical regions.},

  abstract = {Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is a peculiar neural state showing a combination of muscle atonia and intense cortical activity. REM sleep is usually considered as a unitary state in neuroscientific research; however, it is composed of two different microstates: phasic and tonic REM. These differ in awakening thresholds, sensory processing, and cortical oscillations. Nevertheless, studies examining cortical oscillations during REM microstates are scarce, and used low spatial sampling. Here, we analyzed the data of 18 healthy individuals assessed by high-density sleep EEG recordings. We systematically contrasted phasic and tonic REM periods in terms of topographical distribution, source localization, as well as local, global and long-range synchronization of frequency-specific cortical activity. Tonic periods showed relatively increased high alpha and beta power over frontocentral derivations. In addition, higher frequency components of beta power exhibited increased global synchronization during tonic compared to phasic states. In contrast, in phasic periods we found increased power and synchronization of low frequency oscillations coexisting with increased and synchronized gamma activity. Source localization revealed several multimodal, higher-order associative, as well as sensorimotor areas as potential sources of increased high alpha/beta power during tonic compared to phasic REM. Increased gamma power in phasic REM was attributed to medial prefrontal and right lateralized temporal areas associated with emotional processing. Our findings emphasize the heterogeneous nature of REM sleep, expressed in two microstates with remarkably different neural activity. Considering the microarchitecture of REM sleep may provide new insights into the mechanisms of REM sleep in health and disease.},

  abstract = {In recent years, EEG microstate analysis has gained popularity as a tool to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics of large-scale electrophysiology data. It has been used in a wide range of EEG studies and the discovered microstates have been linked to cognitive function and brain diseases. EEG microstates are assumed to (1) be winner-take-all, meaning that the topography at any given time point is in one state; and (2) discretely transition from one state into another. In this study we investigated these assumptions by taking a geometric perspective of EEG data, treating microstate topographies as basis vectors for a subspace of the original channel space. We found that within- and across-microstate distance distributions were largely overlapping: for the low GFP (Global Field Power) range (lower 15\%), individual time points labeled as one microstate are often equidistant to multiple microstate vectors, challenging the winner-take-all assumption. At high global field power, separability of microstates improved, but remained rather weak. Although many GFP peaks (which are the time points used for defining microstates) occur during high GFP ranges, low GFP ranges associated with poor separability also contain GFP peaks. Furthermore, the geometric analysis suggested that microstates and their transitions appear to be more continuous than discrete. The Analysis of rate of change of trajectory in sensor space suggests gradual microstate transitions as opposed to the classical binary view of EEG microstates. Taken together, our findings suggest that EEG microstates are better conceptualized as spatially and temporally continuous, rather than discrete activations of neural populations.},

It is characterized uniquely by a fixed spatial distribution of active neuronal generators with time varying intensity. Brain electrical activity is modeled as being composed of a time sequence of nonoverlapping microstates with variable duration. A precise mathematical formulation of the model for evoked potential recordings is presented, where the microstates are represented as normalized vectors constituted by scalp electric potentials due to the underlying generators. An algorithm is developed for estimating the microstates, based on a modified version of the classical k-means clustering method, in which cluster orientations are estimated, Consequently, each instantaneous multichannel evoked potential measurement is classified as belonging to some microstate, thus producing a natural segmentation of brain activity. Use is made of statistical image segmentation techniques for obtaining smooth continuous segments. Time varying intensities are estimated by projecting the measurements onto their corresponding microstates. A goodness of fit statistic for the model is presented. Finally, a method is introduced for estimating the number of microstates, based on nonparametric data-driven statistical resampling techniques.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

However, how facial attractiveness changes with repeated exposure is still unknown. The event related potential technique was used to examine the underlying neural processing of the repeated exposure effect on facial attractiveness. The results showed that for high attractive faces, attractiveness judgement increased significantly with repeated exposure, underpinned by smaller N170 and larger LPP. The duration of microstate C was negatively correlated with attractiveness judgement. Source location revealed that with repeated exposure, microstate C activated the supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, which are related to attention and emotion processing, respectively. These results suggest repeated exposure affects the cognitive and affective brain systems when processing high attractive faces. Concerning middle attractive faces, with repeated exposure, these were also seen as more attractive, yielding larger EPN. The occurrence of microstate C was positively correlated with attractiveness judgement. Source location revealed that microstate C during repeated exposure activated the middle frontal gyrus.

Spatial analyses of the topography of the spontaneous EEG also show discrete epochs of stable global brain states (so-called microstates), but they remain quasi-stationary for only about 100ms. In order to test the relationship between the rapidly fluctuating EEG-defined microstates and the slowly oscillating fMRI-defined resting states, we recorded 64-channel EEG in the scanner while subjects were at rest with their eyes closed. Conventional EEG-microstate analysis determined the typical four EEG topographies that dominated across all subjects. The convolution of the time course of these maps with the hemodynamic response function allowed to fit a linear model to the fMRI BOLD responses and revealed four distinct distributed networks. These networks were spatially correlated with four of the resting-state networks (RSNs) that were found by the conventional fMRI group-level independent component analysis (ICA). These RSNs have previously been attributed to phonological processing, visual imagery, attention reorientation, and subjective interoceptive–autonomic processing. We found no EEG-correlate of the default mode network. Thus, the four typical microstates of the spontaneous EEG seem to represent the neurophysiological correlate of four of the RSNs and show that they are fluctuating much more rapidly than fMRI alone suggests.},

The cortical circuitry involved in conscious cognitive processes and the subcortical circuitry involved in fear responses have been extensively studied with neuroimaging, but their interactions remain largely unexplored. A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study demonstrated that the engagement of the right prefrontal cortex during the cognitive evaluation of angry and fearful facial expressions is associated with an attenuation of the response of the amygdala to these same stimuli, providing evidence for a functional neural network for emotional regulation.
Methods
In the current study, we have explored the generalizability of this functional network by using threatening and fearful non-face stimuli derived from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), as well as the influence of this network on peripheral autonomic responses.

Similar to the earlier findings with facial expressions, blood oxygen level dependent fMRI revealed that whereas perceptual processing of IAPS stimuli was associated with a bilateral amygdala response, cognitive evaluation of these same stimuli was associated with attenuation of this amygdala response and a correlated increase in response of the right prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, this pattern was reflected in changes in skin conductance.
Conclusions
The current results further implicate the importance of neocortical regions, including the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, in regulating emotional responses mediated by the amygdala through conscious evaluation and appraisal.},

  abstract   = {Schizophrenia patients show abnormalities in a broad range of task demands. Therefore, an explanation common to all these abnormalities has to be sought independently of any particular task, ideally in the brain dynamics before a task takes place or during resting state. For the neurobiological investigation of such baseline states, EEG microstate analysis is particularly well suited, because it identifies sub-second global states of stable connectivity patterns directly related to the recruitment of different types of information processing modes (e.g. integration of top-down and bottom-up information). Meanwhile, there is an accumulation of evidence that particular microstate-networks are selectively affected in schizophrenia. To obtain an overall estimate of the effect-size of these microstate abnormalities, we present a systematic meta-analysis over all studies available to date relating EEG microstates to schizophrenia. Results showed medium size effects for two classes of microstates, namely a class labelled C that was found to be more frequent in schizophrenia, and a class labelled D that was found to be shortened. These abnormalities may correspond to core symptoms of schizophrenia, e.g. insufficient reality testing and self-monitoring as during auditory verbal hallucinations. As interventional studies have shown that these microstate features may be systematically affected using antipsychotic drugs or neurofeedback interventions, these findings may help introducing novel diagnostic and treatment options.},

  abstract = {The momentary, global functional state of the brain is reflected by its electric field configuration. Cluster analytical approaches consistently extracted four head-surface brain electric field configurations that optimally explain the variance of their changes across time in spontaneous EEG recordings. These four configurations are referred to as EEG microstate classes A, B, C, and D and have been associated with verbal/phonological, visual, subjective interoceptive–autonomic processing, and attention reorientation, respectively. The present study tested these associations via an intra-individual and inter-individual analysis approach. The intra-individual approach tested the effect of task-induced increased modality-specific processing on EEG microstate parameters. The inter-individual approach tested the effect of personal modality-specific parameters on EEG microstate parameters. We obtained multichannel EEG from 61 healthy, right-handed, male students during four eyes-closed conditions: object-visualization, spatial-visualization, verbalization (6 runs each), and resting (7 runs). After each run, we assessed participants' degrees of object-visual, spatial-visual, and verbal thinking using subjective reports. Before and after the recording, we assessed modality-specific cognitive abilities and styles using nine cognitive tests and two questionnaires. The EEG of all participants, conditions, and runs was clustered into four classes of EEG microstates (A, B, C, and D). RMANOVAs, ANOVAs and post-hoc paired t-tests compared microstate parameters between conditions. TANOVAs compared microstate class topographies between conditions. Differences were localized using eLORETA. Pearson correlations assessed interrelationships between personal modality-specific parameters and EEG microstate parameters during no-task resting. As hypothesized, verbal as opposed to visual conditions consistently affected the duration, occurrence, and coverage of microstate classes A and B. Contrary to associations suggested by previous reports, parameters were increased for class A during visualization, and class B during verbalization. In line with previous reports, microstate D parameters were increased during no-task resting compared to the three internal, goal-directed tasks. Topographic differences between conditions included particular sub-regions of components of the metabolic default mode network. Modality-specific personal parameters did not consistently correlate with microstate parameters except verbal cognitive style which correlated negatively with microstate class A duration and positively with class C occurrence. This is the first study that aimed to induce EEG microstate class parameter changes based on their hypothesized functional significance. Beyond the associations of microstate classes A and B with visual and verbal processing, respectively, our results suggest that a finely-tuned interplay between all four EEG microstate classes is necessary for the continuous formation of visual and verbal thoughts. Our results point to the possibility that the EEG microstate classes may represent the head-surface measured activity of intra-cortical sources primarily exhibiting inhibitory functions. However, additional studies are needed to verify and elaborate on this hypothesis.},

The results indicate decreased duration of brain microstates in panic patients during all conditions. Comparison of the resting phases with the viewing conditions revealed a significant acceleration of EEG microstates in both the patients and the control subjects. Patients and control subjects differed in the topography of the fields during rest: control subjects showed a left-anterior/right-posterior orientation, while panic patients showed a predominantly right-anterior/left-posterior orientation. Neither group displayed any topographic changes when viewing the mushroom picture. However, when viewing the anxiety-specific casualty picture, panic patients shifted fields in a different way than did control subjects. Centroid topography does not permit clear localization of the cortical generators. It is concluded that panic patients show a generally increased cortical activation compared with healthy control subjects, and activate different neuronal arrays when viewing an anxiety-specific stimulus.},

Event-Related Potentials were recorded while subjects were required to view, suppress emotion expression to, or reappraise emotional pictures. The results showed a similar reduction in self-reported negative emotion during both strategies. Additionally, expressive suppression elicited larger amplitudes than reappraisal in central-frontal P3 component (340–480 ms). More importantly, the Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes were decreased in each 200 ms of the 800–1600 ms time intervals during suppression vs. viewing conditions. In contrast, LPP amplitudes were similar for reappraisal and viewing conditions in all the time windows, except for the decreased amplitudes during reappraisal in the 1400–1600 ms. The LPP (but not P3) amplitudes were positively related to negative mood ratings, whereas the amplitudes of P3, rather than LPP, predict self-reported expressive suppression. These results suggest that expressive suppression decreases emotion responding more rapidly than reappraisal, at the cost of greater cognitive resource involvements in Chinese individuals.},

However, evidence for specific neural correlates of the capacity for cognitive reappraisal, which is a necessary prerequisite for the effective implementation of cognitive reappraisal in everyday life, has been sparse to date. In the present study, the capacity for cognitive reappraisal was studied in terms of the participants’ inventiveness in generating alternative appraisals of anger-evoking events, and was correlated with frontal EEG alpha asymmetry recorded while the participants were generating reappraisals as well as during a common creative idea generation task. During cognitive reappraisal efforts, individuals higher on the capacity for generating cognitive reappraisals showed more left-lateralized activity in lateral prefrontal cortex, specifically in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex extending toward the frontal pole. This effect was observed independently from the activation during novel idea generation without emotional component, indicating that specific demands are implicated in the generation of reappraisals of emotional events. Taken together, the results indicate that individuals higher on the capacity for cognitive reappraisal are more capable or more prone to recruit appropriate brain regions when the situation demands coming up with alternative appraisals of stressful events. The findings may stimulate the development of more individually targeted interventions.},

However, whether non-phase-locked neural oscillations are involved in empathic responses remains unknown. To investigate the functional role of non-phase-locked theta (3–8 Hz) and alpha (9–14 Hz) oscillations in empathy for pain, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy adults who performed pain judgment of pictures of hands in painful or neutral situations. Wavelet analysis was used to calculate EEG spectral power with high time–frequency (TF) resolution. We found that, relative to neutral stimuli, painful stimuli induced increased theta event-related synchronization (ERS) at 200–500 ms but decreased alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) at 200–400 ms, providing evidence for the engagement of theta and alpha activity in empathy for pain. In addition, subjective ratings of perceived pain and self-unpleasantness positively correlated with theta band ERS but negatively correlated with alpha band ERD related to painful stimuli, suggesting that theta and alpha oscillations are respectively involved in emotional sharing and regulation during empathy for pain. Finally, the long-latency upper theta (6–8 Hz) and alpha band TF power significantly decreased by repeated exposure to painful stimuli, indicating short-term adaptive changes of empathy-related neural activity.},

Emotions were evoked on 22 healthy subjects using emotional pictures portraying humans from International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and late response to stimuli was examined (1700-2200 ms). Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 30 channels divided into 10 brain regions: left frontal, right frontal, left temporal, right temporal, frontal, frontocentral, central, centroparietal, parietal and occipital. Negative stimuli, compared to neutral stimuli, significantly increased SASI in frontocentral, central, centroparietal, parietal and occipital areas.

To allow a neuroanatomical interpretation the NoGo-anteriorization was investigated with a new three-dimensional source tomography method (LORETA) was applied.
METHODS: The CPT contains subsets of stimuli requiring the execution (Go) or the inhibition (NoGo) of a cued motor response which can be considered as mutual control conditions for the event-related potential (ERP) study of inhibitory brain functions 21-channel ERPs were obtained from 10 healthy subjects during a cued CPT, and analyzed with LORETA.
RESULTS: Topographic analyses revealed significantly different scalp distributions between the Go and the NoGo conditions in both P100 and P300 microstates, indicating that already at an early stage different neural assemblies are activated. LORETA disclosed a significant hyperactivity located in the right frontal lobe during the NoGo condition in the P300 microstate.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that right frontal sources are responsible for the NoGo-anteriorization of the scalp P300 which is consistent with animal and human lesion studies of inhibitory brain functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that frontal activation is confined to a brief microstate and time-locked to phasic inhibitory motor control. This adds important functional and chronometric specificity to findings of frontal activation obtained with PET and Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy studies during the cued CPT, and suggests that these metabolic results are not due to general task demands.},

However, one of the common practices -- using a subset of sensors in ERP analysis is hard to provide a holistic and precise dynamic results. Selecting or grouping subsets of sensors may also be subject to selection bias, multiple comparison, and further complicated by individual differences in the group-level analysis. More importantly, changes in neural generators and variations in response magnitude from the same neural sources are difficult to separate, which limit the capacity of testing different aspects of cognitive hypotheses. We introduce EasyEEG, a toolbox that includes several multivariate analysis methods to directly test cognitive hypotheses based on topographic responses that include data from all sensors. These multivariate methods can investigate effects in the dimensions of response magnitude and topographic patterns separately using data in the sensor space, therefore enable assessing neural response dynamics. The concise workflow and the modular design provide user-friendly and programmer-friendly features.

  abstract   = {Distraction and reappraisal are two widely used forms of emotion regulation. The process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 1998) holds that they differ (1) in when they act on the emotion-generative process, and (2) in their impact on subsequent responses to regulated stimuli. We tested these two predictions by measuring electrocortical responses to neutral and emotional images during two phases. In the regulation phase, images were watched or regulated using distraction or reappraisal. During the re-exposure phase, the same images were passively watched. As predicted, during regulation, distraction reduced the late positive potential (LPP) earlier than reappraisal. Upon re-exposure, images with a distraction (but not reappraisal) history elicited a larger LPP than images with an attend history. This pattern of results suggests that distraction and reappraisal intervene at separate stages during emotion generation, a feature which may have distinct consequences that extend beyond the regulatory episode.},

The present study examined the time-course of automatic and controlled modulation of the late positive potential (LPP) during emotional picture viewing.
Methods
Participants (N=32) viewed neutral and unpleasant stimuli for 6000ms; at 3000ms, one of two tones signaled participants to attend either to a more or less arousing portion of the picture. The time-course of the LPP was examined both during the passive viewing and directed attention portions of the trial using the method proposed by Guthrie and Buchwald [Guthrie D, Buchwald JS. Significance testing of difference potentials. Psychophysiology 1991;28(2):240–4].
Results
During passive viewing, the LPP became reliably larger following the presentation of unpleasant pictures from 160ms onward; the magnitude of the LPP became reliably smaller beginning 620ms after participants were instructed to attend to the less arousing aspects of unpleasant pictures – and this difference was maintained throughout the duration of the trial.
Conclusions
The LPP reflects relatively automatic attention to emotional visual stimuli, but is also sensitive to manipulations of directed attention toward arousing versus neutral aspects of such stimuli.
Significance
These results shed further light on the time-course of emotional and cognitive modulation of the LPP, and suggest that the LPP reflects the relatively rapid and dynamic allocation of increased attention to emotional stimuli.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Filtering is a ubiquitous step in the preprocessing of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Besides the intended effect of the attenuation of signal components considered as noise, filtering can also result in various unintended adverse filter effects (distortions such as smoothing) and filter artifacts.
METHOD: We give some practical guidelines for the evaluation of filter responses (impulse and frequency response) and the selection of filter types (high-pass/low-pass/band-pass/band-stop; finite/infinite impulse response, FIR/IIR) and filter parameters (cutoff frequencies, filter order and roll-off, ripple, delay and causality) to optimize signal-to-noise ratio and avoid or reduce signal distortions for selected electrophysiological applications.
RESULTS: Various filter implementations in common electrophysiology software packages are introduced and discussed. Resulting filter responses are compared and evaluated.
CONCLUSION: We present strategies for recognizing common adverse filter effects and filter artifacts and demonstrate them in practical examples. Best practices and recommendations for the selection and reporting of filter parameters, limitations, and alternatives to filtering are discussed.},

  abstract = {Dynamic changes in ERP topographies can be conveniently analyzed by means of microstates, the so-called “atoms of thoughts”, that represent brief periods of quasi-stable synchronized network activation. Comparing temporal microstate features such as on- and offset or duration between groups and conditions therefore allows a precise assessment of the timing of cognitive processes. So far, this has been achieved by assigning the individual time-varying ERP maps to spatially defined microstate templates obtained from clustering the grand mean data into predetermined numbers of topographies (microstate prototypes). Features obtained from these individual assignments were then statistically compared. This has the problem that the individual noise dilutes the match between individual topographies and templates leading to lower statistical power. We therefore propose a randomization-based procedure that works without assigning grand-mean microstate prototypes to individual data. In addition, we propose a new criterion to select the optimal number of microstate prototypes based on cross-validation across subjects. After a formal introduction, the method is applied to a sample data set of an N400 experiment and to simulated data with varying signal-to-noise ratios, and the results are compared to existing methods. In a first comparison with previously employed statistical procedures, the new method showed an increased robustness to noise, and a higher sensitivity for more subtle effects of microstate timing. We conclude that the proposed method is well-suited for the assessment of timing differences in cognitive processes. The increased statistical power allows identifying more subtle effects, which is particularly important in small and scarce patient populations.},

Because of the increasing interest in the temporal dynamics of brain networks, and because of the straightforward compatibility of the EEG with other brain imaging techniques, EEG is increasingly used in the neuroimaging community. However, the full capability of EEG is highly underestimated. Many combined EEG-fMRI studies use the EEG only as a spike-counter or an oscilloscope. Many cognitive and clinical EEG studies use the EEG still in its traditional way and analyze grapho-elements at certain electrodes and latencies. We here show that this way of using the EEG is not only dangerous because it leads to misinterpretations, but it is also largely ignoring the spatial aspects of the signals. In fact, EEG primarily measures the electric potential field at the scalp surface in the same way as MEG measures the magnetic field. By properly sampling and correctly analyzing this electric field, EEG can provide reliable information about the neuronal activity in the brain and the temporal dynamics of this activity in the millisecond range. This review explains some of these analysis methods and illustrates their potential in clinical and experimental applications.},

  abstract   = {Introduction Cognitive reappraisal, an important strategy of emotion regulation, can change emotional experience and attention to emotional information. However, not all individuals can deploy reappraisal strategies successfully. In the current study, we investigated event-related potential (ERP) characteristics of reappraisal success and of reappraisal failure. Methods Twenty-six participants were divided into the success group or the failure group based on self-report ratings of how successful they were in reducing their response to negative images using cognitive reappraisal strategy. All participants viewed 30 neutral images and 30 negative images which they were asked to just watch, and 30 negative stimuli that they were asked to reappraise, while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Results The success group reported a significant reduction in the unpleasantness of negative images than the failure group in the negative-reappraisal condition. The ERP data indicated that two time windows differentiated between the success and failure groups. In 200–300 ms, P200 was significantly more positive to the negative-watch condition relative to both negative-reappraisal and neutral conditions in the failure group, while no difference was observed in the success group. In 300–5,000 ms, cognitive reappraisal led to increased late positive potential (LPP) relative to negative-watch in the early and middle latency windows (300–3,100 ms) in both groups; in the late latency window (3,100–5,000 ms), the reappraisal success group showed the LPP amplitude to the negative-reappraisal stimuli to be more positive than to the negative-watch stimuli, while no difference was found in the reappraisal failure group. Conclusion Our study provided direct evidence that different neurophysiological features were associated with reappraisal success and failure while engaging in the reappraisal of negative stimuli. This result will contribute to better understanding of the neural mechanism of emotion regulation in emotional disorders (i.e., depression and anxiety).},

However, whether BFM works through a top-down emotional regulation strategy to alter brain dynamics and its relationship with individual differences in trait mindfulness are unclear. Event-related potentials (ERPs) of 20 healthy BFM-naïve undergraduates were recorded when they conducted BFM/viewing tasks while viewing affective pictures. Participants completed the Attentional Control Scale (ACS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). The results indicated that under the viewing condition, positive and negative pictures elicited greater P1, N2, and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes than did neutral pictures. However, BFM attenuated P1, N2, and LPP amplitudes for positive and negative pictures but not for neutral pictures. P1 amplitudes for emotional minus neutral pictures correlated with individual differences in focus attention measured by the ACS, while N2 amplitudes for emotional minus neutral pictures correlated with individual differences in trait mindfulness measured by the MAAS. These observations suggest that, consistent with the dual-process model, BFM is an effective emotion regulation strategy and might activate the dorsal top-down prefrontal system to alter early and late neural dynamics of affective processing.},

  abstract   = {Rapid and accurate detection of threat is adaptive. Yet, threat-related attentional biases, including hypervigilance, avoidance, and attentional disengagement delays, may contribute to the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Behavioral measures of attentional bias generally indicate that threat demands more attentional resources; however, indices exploring differential allocation of attention using reaction time fail to clarify the time course by which attention is deployed under threatening circumstances in healthy and anxious populations. In this review, we conduct an interpretive synthesis of 28 attentional bias studies focusing on event-related potentials (ERPs) as a primary outcome to inform an ERP model of the neural chronometry of attentional bias in healthy and anxious populations. The model posits that both healthy and anxious populations display modulations of early ERP components, including the P1, N170, P2, and N2pc, in response to threatening and emotional stimuli, suggesting that both typical and abnormal patterns of attentional bias are characterized by enhanced allocation of attention to threat and emotion at earlier stages of processing. Compared to anxious populations, healthy populations more clearly demonstrate modulations of later components, such as the P3, indexing conscious and evaluative processing of threat and emotion and disengagement difficulties at later stages of processing. Findings from the interpretive synthesis, existing bias models, and extant neural literature on attentional systems are then integrated to inform a conceptual model of the processes and substrates underlying threat appraisal and resource allocation in healthy and anxious populations. To conclude, we discuss therapeutic interventions for attentional bias and future directions.},

present study, the time course and underlying mechanisms for such fast differentiation are of interest. We investigated the
involvement of the primary visual cortex in affective evaluation of conditioned stimuli (CSs). In order to elicit learning
within the visual system we chose affective pictures as unconditioned stimuli and used laterally presented gratings as CSs.
Using high-density electroencephalography, we demonstrated modulation of the C1 visual event-related component for threat-related
stimuli versus neutral stimuli, which increased with continuing acquisition of affective meaning. The differentiation between
aversive and neutral visual stimuli occurred as early as 65–90 ms after stimulus onset and suggested involvement of the primary
visual areas in affective evaluation. As an underlying mechanism, we discuss short-term reorganization in visual cortex, enabling
sensory amplification of specific visual features that are related to motivationally relevant information.},

  abstract = {It is generally assumed that affective picture viewing is related to higher levels of physiological arousal than is the reading of emotional words. However, this assertion is based mainly on studies in which the processing of either words or pictures has been investigated under heterogenic conditions. Positive, negative, relaxing, neutral, and background (stimulus fragments) words and pictures were presented to subjects in two experiments under equivalent experimental conditions. In Experiment 1, neutral words elicited an enhanced late positive component (LPC) that was associated with an increased difficulty in discriminating neutral from background stimuli. In Experiment 2, high-arousing pictures elicited an enhanced early negativity and LPC that were related to a facilitated processing for these stimuli. Thus, it seems that under some circumstances, the processing of affective information captures attention only with more biologically relevant stimuli. Also, these data might be better interpreted on the basis of those models that postulate a different access to affective information for words and pictures.},

  abstract = {According to the traditional two-stage model of face processing, the face-specific N170 event-related potential (ERP) is linked to structural encoding of face stimuli, whereas later ERP components are thought to reflect processing of facial affect. This view has recently been challenged by reports of N170 modulations by emotional facial expression. This study examines the time-course and topography of the influence of emotional expression on the N170 response to faces.
Dense-array ERPs were recorded in response to a set (n = 16) of fear and neutral faces. Stimuli were normalized on dimensions of shape, size and luminance contrast distribution. To minimize task effects related to facial or emotional processing, facial stimuli were irrelevant to a primary task of learning associative pairings between a subsequently presented visual character and a spoken word.
N170 to faces showed a strong modulation by emotional facial expression. A split half analysis demonstrates that this effect was significant both early and late in the experiment and was therefore not associated with only the initial exposures of these stimuli, demonstrating a form of robustness against habituation. The effect of emotional modulation of the N170 to faces did not show significant interaction with the gender of the face stimulus, or hemisphere of recording sites. Subtracting the fear versus neutral topography provided a topography that itself was highly similar to the face N170.
The face N170 response can be influenced by emotional expressions contained within facial stimuli. The topography of this effect is consistent with the notion that fear stimuli exaggerates the N170 response itself. This finding stands in contrast to previous models suggesting that N170 processes linked to structural analysis of faces precede analysis of emotional expression, and instead may reflect early top-down modulation from neural systems involved in rapid emotional processing.},

  abstract = {Facial emotions represent an important part of non-verbal communication used in everyday life. Recent studies on emotional processing have implicated differing brain regions for different emotions, but little has been determined on the timing of this processing. Here we presented a large number of unfamiliar faces expressing the six basic emotions, plus neutral faces, to 26 young adults while recording event-related potentials (ERPs). Subjects were naive with respect to the specific questions investigated; it was an implicit emotional task. ERPs showed global effects of emotion from 90 ms (P1), while latency and amplitude differences among emotional expressions were seen from 140 ms (N170 component). Positive emotions evoked N170 significantly earlier than negative emotions and the amplitude of N170 evoked by fearful faces was larger than neutral or surprised faces. At longer latencies (330-420 ms) at fronto-central sites, we also found a different pattern of effects among emotions. Localization analyses confirmed the superior and middle-temporal regions for early processing of facial expressions; the negative emotions elicited later, distinctive activations. The data support a model of automatic, rapid processing of emotional expressions.},

We found that negative pictures elicited a larger late positive potential (LPP) than neutral pictures. Moreover, processes involved in strategy also had an effect on LPP amplitude, which was indicated by a larger LPP in reappraisal compared with suppression and viewing tasks when neutral pictures were presented. After the influence of processes on LPP was excluded, results showed that reappraisal effectively decreased the emotion-enhanced LPP than suppression and viewing. The difference in regulatory effect may be determined by the underlying processing mechanism. A larger frontal-central component, N2, was observed in suppression than reappraisal and viewing, which suggested that it involved the processes focusing on behavioral response. While the larger LPP found in reappraisal implicated that it recruited cognitive processes focusing on the picture meaning.},

Affective stimulus factors primarily modulate ERP component amplitude, with little change in peak latency observed. Arousal effects are consistently obtained, and generally occur at longer latencies. Valence effects are inconsistently reported at several latency ranges, including very early components. Some affective ERP modulations vary with recording methodology, stimulus factors, as well as task-relevance and emotional state. Affective ERPs have been linked theoretically to attention orientation for unpleasant pictures at earlier components ({\textless}300ms). Enhanced stimulus processing has been associated with memory encoding for arousing pictures of assumed intrinsic motivational relevance, with task-induced differences contributing to emotional reactivity at later components ({\textgreater}300ms). Theoretical issues, stimulus factors, task demands, and individual differences are discussed.},

The affective content of the stimulation was assessed, through questionnaires, by the participants themselves. N1 showed different patterns of habituation as a function of the stimulation: amplitudes indicated that S− was more resistant to habituation than S0 and S+. This pattern, which reflects a greater capacity of S− to attract and maintain the participant's attention, is interpreted as a manifestation of the “negativity bias,” a phenomenon that reflects an evolution-favored set of mechanisms that facilitate a rapid and intense response to aversive events.},

Experiment 2 presented the same normal color pictures with large, medium, and small scrambled condition (2, 1, and 0.5 cm squares). The P300 event-related brain potential demonstrated larger amplitudes over frontal areas for positive compared to negative or neutral images for normal color pictures in both experiments. Attenuated and nonsignificant valence effects were obtained for black/white images. Scrambled stimuli in each study yielded no valence effects but demonstrated typical P300 topography that increased from frontal to parietal areas.

In particular, stimulus discrimination and motor response selection and inhibition processes are crucial. We investigated the neural mechanisms responsible for fencers' fast and flexible behaviour recording event-related potentials (ERPs) in discriminative reaction task (DRT, Go/No-go task) and simple reaction task (SRT) to visual stimuli. In the DRT, in addition to faster RTs measured in fencers with respect to control subjects, three main electrophysiological differences were found. First, attentional modulation of the visual processing taking place in the occipital lobes and reaching a peak at 170 ms was enhanced in the athletes group. Second, the activity in the posterior cingulate gyrus, associated with the stimulus discrimination stage, started earlier in fencers than controls (150 ms versus 200 ms) and the peak had larger amplitude. Third, the activity at the level of the prefrontal cortex (time range: 250-350 ms), associated with response selection stage and particularly with motor inhibition process, was stronger in fencers. No differences between athletes and controls were found in the SRT for both ERPs and RTs. Concluding, the fencers' ability to cope to the opponent feint switching quickly from an intended action to a new more appropriate action is likely due to a faster stimulus discrimination facilitated by higher attention and by stronger inhibition activity in prefrontal cortex.},

ERPs were measured while subjects rated the emotional content of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral pictures. As was expected, subsequent recall was better for pleasant and unpleasant pictures than for neutral pictures. The emotion effect was sensitive to arousal in parietal electrodes and to both arousal and valence in frontocentral electrodes. The subsequent memory effect at centroparietal electrodes was greater for emotional pictures than for neutral pictures during an early epoch (400–600 msec). This result suggests that emotional information has privileged access to processing resources, possibly leading to better memory formation.},

As observed for longer picture presentations, brief affective pictures were selectively processed. Specifically, pleasant and unpleasant pictures were associated with an early endogenous negative shift over temporo-occipital sensors compared to neutral images. In addition, affective pictures elicited enlarged late positive potentials over centro-parietal sensor sites relative to neutral images.

  abstract   = {We investigated the capability of emotional and nonemotional visual stimulation to capture automatic attention, an aspect of the interaction between cognitive and emotional processes that has received scant attention from researchers. Event-related potentials were recorded from 37 subjects using a 60-electrode array, and were submitted to temporal and spatial principal component analyses to detect and quantify the main components, and to source localization software (LORETA) to determine their spatial origin. Stimuli capturing automatic attention were of three types: emotionally positive, emotionally negative, and nonemotional pictures. Results suggest that initially (P1: 105 msec after stimulus), automatic attention is captured by negative pictures, and not by positive or nonemotional ones. Later (P2: 180 msec), automatic attention remains captured by negative pictures, but also by positive ones. Finally (N2: 240 msec), attention is captured only by positive and nonemotional stimuli. Anatomically, this sequence is characterized by decreasing activation of the visual association cortex (VAC) and by the growing involvement, from dorsal to ventral areas, of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Analyses suggest that the ACC and not the VAC is responsible for experimental effects described above. Intensity, latency, and location of neural activity related to automatic attention thus depend clearly on the stimulus emotional content and on its associated biological importance.},

  abstract = {Event-related potentials were recorded from 30 subjects using sustained stimulation and an indirect task, two strategies which facilitate affective responses that are complete and free of cognitive interference. Stimuli were of three types: pleasant, unpleasant and neutral. A three-phase pattern was found. The first phase, an amplitude increase in response to negative stimuli higher than to neutral and pleasant stimuli, was produced at 160 ms after stimulus onset, the prefrontal cortex being the origin of this phase. The second phase, characterized by maximal amplitudes in response to positive stimuli, was produced at 400 ms, originating in the visual cortex. Finally, the third phase, another amplitude increase in response to negative stimuli, was produced at 680 ms, and its source was located in the left precentral gyrus. Present data show that the cortical response to sustained emotional visual stimulation presented within indirect tasks provides information on attention-, motivation- and motor-related biases that complement information obtained under other experimental conditions.},

  abstract = {In natural situations, unpredictable events processing often interacts with the ongoing cognitive activities. In a similar manner, the insertion of deviant unpredictable stimuli into a classical oddball task evokes both the P3a and P3b event-related potentials (ERPs) components that are, respectively, thought to index reallocation of attentional resources or inhibitory process and memory updating mechanism. This study aims at characterising the influence of the emotional arousal and valence of a deviant and unpredictable non-target stimulus on these components. ERPs were recorded from 28 sites during a visual three-stimulus oddball paradigm. Unpleasant, neutral and pleasant pictures served as non-target unpredictable items and subjects were asked to realize a perceptually difficult standard/target discrimination task. A temporal principal component analysis (PCA) allowed us to show that non-target pictures elicited both a P3a and a P3b. Moreover, the P3b component was modulated by the emotional arousal and the valence of the pictures. Thus, the memory updating process may be modulated by the affective arousal and valence of unpredictable disturbing stimuli, even if the task does not require any explicit emotional categorization.

For the two most frequent prestimulus microstate classes (oriented left anterior-right posterior and right anterior-left posterior), ERP map series were selectively averaged. The post-stimulus ERP grand average map series was segmented into microstates; 10 were found. The centroid locations of positive and negative map areas were extracted as landscape descriptors. Significant differences (MANOVAs and t-tests) between the two prestimulus classes were found in four of the ten ERP microstates. The relative orientation of the two ERP microstate classes was the same as prestimulus in some ERP microstates, but reversed in others. — Thus, brain electric microstates at stimulus arrival influence the landscapes of the post-stimulus ERP maps and therefore, information processing; prestimulus microstate effects differed for different post-stimulus ERP microstates.},

Comparing correctly identified targets with and without awareness allowed us to contrast differences in awareness while keeping performance constant for identical physical stimuli. Two distinct pre-stimulus scalp potential fields (microstate maps) dissociated correct identification with and without awareness, and their estimated intracranial generators were stronger in primary visual cortex before correct identification without awareness. This difference in activity cannot be explained by differences in alpha power or phase which were less reliably linked with differential pre-stimulus activation of primary visual cortex. Our results shed a new light on the function of pre-stimulus activity in early visual cortex in visual awareness and emphasize the importance of trial-by-trials analysis of the spatial configuration of the scalp potential field identified with multichannel EEG.},

  abstract = {Objective
A number of studies provide supporting evidence for changes in synchronization during anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. This study investigates how anesthetic administration affects the widespread patterns of phase synchrony.
Methods
The recently introduced method of Spatial Analytic Phase Difference (SAPD) was used to measure changes in synchrony in the electroencephalogram (EEG) activity of 29 patients undergoing routine surgery. Analysis was performed over 9 frequency bands: (i) δ (1.5–3.5Hz); (ii) θ (3.5–7.5Hz); (iii) α1 (8–10Hz); (iv) α2 (10.5–12Hz); (v) β1 (12.5–18Hz); (vi) β2 (18.5–21Hz); (vii) β3 (21.5–30Hz); (viii) γ1 (30.5–40Hz); and (ix) γ2 (60–80Hz).
Results
Anesthesia was characterized by (a) large and localized synchrony increases in mid-frequency bands (8–12Hz), (b) smaller and widespread synchrony increases in higher frequency bands (30.5–40Hz, 60–80Hz), and (c) both increase and decrease of synchrony in low frequency bands (1.5–7.5Hz).
Conclusions
This study supports anesthetic-induced changes in synchrony, with the inducement of persistent and reversible widespread γ synchrony being most prominent.
Significance
Our findings have implications in the study of consciousness, support existing literature in the field and contribute towards the theoretical understanding of the mechanisms behind loss of consciousness. Future investigations could result in a synchrony-based measure for monitoring the level of hypnosis of patients during surgery.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is the standard diagnosis method for a wide variety of diseases such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, encephalopathies, and coma, among others. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) is currently a technique used in research in both healthy individuals as well as patients. EEG and fMRI are procedures used to obtain direct and indirect measurements of brain neural activity: EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp, and fMRI detects the changes in blood oxygenation that occur in response to neural activity. EEG has a high temporal resolution and low spatial resolution, while fMRI has high spatial resolution and low temporal resolution. Thus, the combination of EEG with rs-fMRI using different methods could be very useful for research and clinical applications. In this article, we describe and show the results of a new methodology for processing rs-fMRI using seeds positioned according to the 10-10 EEG standard. We analyze the functional connectivity and adjacency matrices obtained using 65 seeds based on 10-10 EEG scheme and 21 seeds based on 10-20 EEG. Connectivity networks are created using each 10-20 EEG seeds and are analyzed by comparisons to the seven networks that have been found in recent studies. The proposed method captures high correlation between contralateral seeds, ipsilateral and contralateral occipital seeds, and some in the frontal lobe.},

However, artifacts in EEG data introduced by the MR scanner still remain a major obstacle.

Specifically, low-frequency EEG ({\textless}20Hz) is strongly correlated with in-scanner movement. Accordingly, minor head motion ({\textless}0.2mm) induces spurious effects in a twofold manner: Small differences in task-correlated motion elicit spurious low-frequency effects, and, as motion concurrently influences fMRI data, EEG–BOLD correlations closely match motion-fMRI correlations. We demonstrate these effects in a memory encoding experiment showing that obtained theta power ({\textasciitilde}3–7Hz) effects and channel-level theta–BOLD correlations reflect motion in the scanner. These findings highlight an important caveat that needs to be addressed by future EEG-fMRI studies.},

Microstate segmentation used a data-driven strategy. Different microstates, i.e. different brain electric landscapes must have been generated by activity of different neural assemblies and therefore are hypothesized to constitute different functions. The two types of reported experiences were associated with significantly different microstates (mean duration 121 ms) immediately preceding the prompts; these microstates showed, across subjects, for abstract thought (compared to visual imagery) a shift of the electric gravity center to the left and a clockwise rotation of the field axis. Contrariwise, the microstates 2 s before the prompt did not differ between the two types of experiences. The results support the hypothesis that different microstates of the brain as recognized in its electric field implement different conscious, reportable mind states, i.e. different classes (types) of thoughts (mentations); thus, the microstates might be candidates for the `atoms of thought'.},

For adaptive segmentation of map series into spatially stationary epochs, the maps at the times of maximal map relief are selected and spatially described by the 3wo locations of maximal and minimal (extreme) potentials; a segment ends if over time an extreme leaves its pre-set spatial window. Over 6 objects, the resting alpha EEG showed 210 msec mean segment duration; segments longer than 323 msec covered 50\% of the total time; the most prominent segment class (1.5\% of all classes) covered 20\% of total time (prominence varied strongly over classes; not all possible classes occured). Spectral power and phase of averages of adaptive and pre-determined segments demonstrated the adequacy of the strategy, and the homegeneity of adaptive segment classes by their reduced within-class variance. It is suggested that different segment classes manifest different brain functional states exerting different effects on information processing. The spatially stationary segments might be basic building blocks of brain information processing, possibly operationalizing consciousness time and offering a common phenomenology for spontaneous activity and event-related potentials. The functional significance of segments might be modes or steps of information processing or performance, tested, e.g., as reaction time.},

  abstract   = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful method of studying the electrophysiology of the brain with high temporal resolution. Several analytical approaches to extract information from the EEG signal have been proposed. One method, termed microstate analysis, considers the multichannel EEG recording as a series of quasi-stable "microstates" that are each characterized by a unique topography of electric potentials over the entire channel array. Because this technique simultaneously considers signals recorded from all areas of the cortex, it is capable of assessing the function of large-scale brain networks whose disruption is associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we first introduce the method of EEG microstate analysis. We then review studies that have discovered significant changes in the resting-state microstate series in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and behavioral states. We discuss the potential utility of this method in detecting neurophysiological impairments in disease and monitoring neurophysiological changes in response to an intervention. Finally, we discuss how the resting-state microstate series may reflect rapid switching among neural networks while the brain is at rest, which could represent activity of resting-state networks described by other neuroimaging modalities. We conclude by commenting on the current and future status of microstate analysis, and suggest that EEG microstates represent a promising neurophysiological tool for understanding and assessing brain network dynamics on a millisecond timescale in health and disease.},

  abstract   = {Functional neuroimaging studies examining the neural bases of the cognitive control of emotion have found increased prefrontal and decreased amygdala activation for the reduction or down-regulation of negative emotion. It is unknown, however, (1) whether the same neural systems underlie the enhancement or up-regulation of emotion, and (2) whether altering the nature of the regulatory strategy alters the neural systems mediating the regulation. To address these questions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants up- and down-regulated negative emotion either by focusing internally on the self-relevance of aversive scenes or by focusing externally on alternative meanings for pictured actions and their situational contexts. Results indicated (1a) that both up- and down-regulating negative emotion recruited prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions implicated in cognitive control, (1b) that amygdala activation was modulated up or down in accord with the regulatory goal, and (1c) that up-regulation uniquely recruited regions of left rostromedial PFC implicated in the retrieval of emotion knowledge, whereas down-regulation uniquely recruited regions of right lateral and orbital PFC implicated in behavioral inhibition. Results also indicated that (2) self-focused regulation recruited medial prefrontal regions implicated in internally focused processing, whereas situation-focused regulation recruited lateral prefrontal regions implicated in externally focused processing. These data suggest that both common and distinct neural systems support various forms of reappraisal and that which particular prefrontal systems modulate the amygdala in different ways depends on the regulatory goal and strategy employed.},

The paper starts with a brief outline of the conceptual framework underlying the relationship between P3 amplitude and task demands, and the cognitive task manipulations that determine demands on capacity. P3 amplitude results are then discussed on the basis of an extensive review of the relevant literature. It is concluded that although it has often been assumed that P3 amplitude depends on the capacity for processing task relevant stimuli, the utility of P3 amplitude as a sensitive and diagnostic measure of processing capacity remains limited. The major factor that prompts this conclusion is that the two principal task variables that have been used to manipulate capacity allocation, namely task difficulty and task emphasis, have opposite effects on the amplitude of P3. I suggest that this is because, in many tasks, an increase in difficulty transforms the structure or actual content of the flow of information in the processing systems, thereby interfering with the very processes that underlie P3 generation. Finally, in an attempt to theoretically integrate the results of the reviewed studies, it is proposed that P3 amplitude reflects activation of elements in a event-categorization network that is controlled by the joint operation of attention and working memory.},

The time course of reappraisal-related neural modulation remains unclear, and it is unknown whether the electrocortical response to emotional stimuli is sensitive to reappraisal. Event-related brain potentials were recorded first while participants passively viewed pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral pictures, and then during an emotion regulation block in which participants were instructed to attend to or reappraise unpleasant pictures. The late positive potential (LPP) was enhanced for pleasant and unpleasant pictures in the passive viewing block, and reappraisal resulted in a reliably reduced LPP—a protracted modulation that began 200 msec after stimulus onset. The degree of LPP modulation was positively related to reductions in the self-reported emotional intensity that followed emotion regulation instructions. These results indicate that reappraisal modulates early electrocortical activity that is related to emotional salience, and that the LPP is a useful tool for studying emotion regulation.},

A neurodevelopmental perspective on mindfulness has been advocated as a powerful tool to enhance our understanding of underlying neurocognitive changes that have implications for developmental well-being research and the implementation of mindfulness in education. To stimulate more research in the developmental cognitive neuroscience of mindfulness, this article outlines possible indexes of mindfulness-based change in adolescence, with a focus on event-related brain potential (ERP) markers. We provide methodological recommendations for future studies and offer examples of research paradigms. We also discuss how mindfulness practice could impact on the development of prefrontal brain structures and enhance attention control and emotion regulation skills in adolescents, impacting in turn on their self-regulation and coping skills. We highlight advantages of the ERP methodology in neurodevelopmental research of mindfulness. It is proposed that research using established experimental tasks targeting ERP components such as the contingent negative variability, N200, error-related negativity and error positivity, P300, and late positive potential could elucidate developmentally salient shifts in the neural plasticity of the adolescent brain induced by mindfulness practice.},

The study of event-related potentials (ERPs)--signal-averaged EEG recordings that are time-locked to perceptual, cognitive, and motor events--has increased dramatically in recent years, but until now there has been no comprehensive guide to ERP methodology comparable to those available for fMRI techniques. Event-Related Potentials meets the need for a practical and concise handbook of ERP methods that is suitable for both the novice user of an ERP system and a researcher more experienced in cognitive electrophysiology. The chapters in the first section discuss the design of ERP experiments, providing a practical foundation for understanding the design of ERP experiments and interpreting ERP data. Topics covered include quantification of ERP data and theoretical and practical aspects of ANOVAs as applied to ERP datasets. The second section presents a variety of approaches to ERP data analysis and includes chapters on digital filtering, artifact removal, source localization, and wavelet analysis. The chapters in the final section of the book cover the use of ERPs in relation to such specific participant populations as children and neuropsychological patients and the ways in which ERPs can be combined with related methodologies, including intracranial ERPs and hemodynamic imaging.},

The main contention is that pure insertion is not valid in relation to the neuronal instantiation of cognitive processes. Pure insertion asserts that there are no interactions among the cognitive components of a task. It is possible to evaluate and refute this assumption by testing explicitly for interactions using factorial experimental designs. It is proposed that factorial designs are more powerful than subtraction designs in characterizing cognitive neuroanatomy, precisely because they allow for interactions and eschew notions like pure insertion. In particular we suggest that the effect of a cognitive component (i.e., an effect that is independent of other components) is best captured by the main (activation) effect of that component and that the integration among components (i.e., the expression of one cognitive process in the context of another) can be assessed with the interaction terms. In this framework a complete characterization of cognitive neuroanatomy includes both regionally specific activations and regionally specific interactions. To illustrate our point we have used a factorial experimental design to show that inferotemporal activations, due to object recognition, are profoundly modulated by phonological retrieval of the object's name. This interaction implicates the inferotemporal regions in phonological retrieval, during object naming, despite the fact that phonological retrieval does not, by itself, activate this region.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of fMRI studies of reappraisal and fear extinction, with the aim of examining both commonalities and differences in their neural correlates. We also conducted independent analyses that focused on specific reappraisal strategies (reinterpretation, distancing). Overall, we observed that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the bilateral anterior insular cortex (AIC) were similarly consistently engaged by reappraisal and extinction. Extinction was more consistently linked to activation of sensory and emotion processing regions, whereas reappraisal was more consistently associated with activation of a dorsal fronto-parietal network. Interestingly, the amygdala was preferentially deactivated by distancing. These results suggest that the dACC and the AIC are involved in domain-general regulatory networks. Differences between extinction and reappraisal could be explained by their relative processing demands on visual perceptual versus higher cognitive neural systems.},

  abstract   = {Objectives
Emotion regulation is one of the most prevalent objectives for real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) studies. The existing studies differ in a number of methodological parameters. This study provides a literature review of the main parameters and results of studies using rt-fMRI-NF for emotion regulation enhancement.
Method
A search of the Web of Science database up through November 8, 2018, identified 144 articles written in English, 89 of which were excluded as irrelevant for this study. The remaining 51 original studies and four secondary analyses of previously published original studies were included in the literature review. The selection of target brain areas, target populations, emotion regulation protocols, NF presentation, control group types, and emotion regulation instructions were examined in relation to achieved brain regulation and changes in cognitive or clinical outcomes. Study results were evaluated in terms of their statistical robustness.
Results
The results show that healthy people are able to regulate their brain activity in the presence of rt-fMRI-NF from various brain regions related to emotion regulation, including the amygdala, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex. The regulation of brain activity using rt-fMRI-NF from prefrontal-limbic connectivity or from individually navigated brain areas is feasible as well. Most studies that used a control group show that rt-fMRI-NF actually induces some effects on brain regulation, cognitive variables, and clinical variables. Generally, the success of ROI regulation during NF training is related to the combination of target brain region, the type of emotion regulation task, and the population undergoing the training. In terms of patient groups, the strongest support for the beneficial effects of rt-fMRI-NF has been shown in increased positive emotion experiencing in patients with depression and in decreased anxiety in patients with anxiety disorders. Symptom reduction following NF training has been also reported in patients with PTSD, BPD, and schizophrenia, but direct comparisons with control groups in these studies makes it impossible to evaluate the added value of NF. Studies often do not report all the relevant analyses for evaluating NF success and many studies lack statistical robustness.
Conclusions
Overall, rt-fMRI-NF seems a promising tool for emotion regulation enhancement with the potential to induce long-term symptom reduction in patients with various mental disorders. Preplanning of statistical analyses, careful interpretations of the results, and evaluations of the NF effect on symptom reduction in patient groups is recommended.},

Emotion regulation was measured following the mood inductions as self-reported change in negative mood and as attention interference in a task with mood-congruent emotional distracters. Greater frontal EEG activity during the mood inductions versus baseline was associated with more effective emotion regulation: less post-induction sadness and anxiety and reduced mood-congruent attention interference effects.

Recent studies indicate that decreased activity of the left frontal cortex can be treated as a neural marker of emotion disorders. The present study examined how resting state frontal alpha asymmetry could predict emotion regulation difficulties and related dimensions by resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, and a measure of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Eighty participants completed the resting state EEG recording and DERS ratings. Results revealed that after controlling for gender and depression scores, those participants with higher left frontal activity than the right frontal activity in the resting state have less difficulties in everyday emotion regulation, especially in the dimension of impulse control. However, there was no relation pattern with other dimensions of DERS. This study provided evidence that resting state frontal alpha asymmetry could predict emotion regulation difficulties, mainly in impulse control.},

  abstract = {Effective emotion-regulation is central to emotional intelligence. Relationships between the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS) and wellbeing may reflect individual differences in the strategies used for regulating negative emotions. The present study (N=136) manipulated emotion-regulation strategy during viewing of a fear-inducing film clip. EEG response was assessed across five frequency bands in reappraisal, suppression and control conditions. The TMMS predicted higher power in theta and gamma bands, a pattern of response that may represent directed attention to emotional processing. Gender differences included elevated theta in females in the reappraisal condition, but effects of gender and Trait Meta-Mood appeared to be dissociable.},

Hughes (Psychology and Aging, 2019[May], Vol 34[3], 341-347). The text “We also did observe or predict” should read “We also did not observe, nor did we predict” in the following sentence of the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section: “We also did observe or predict, age-related differences in FAA among participants who either reported low usage of both emotion regulation strategies or high usage of both strategies.” (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-14253-001.) Lateralized asymmetrical activity in the alpha frequency band over the frontal cortex (i.e., frontal alpha asymmetry [FAA]) is robustly related to motivation and emotion. For example, left FAA is related to approach-motivation, positive emotions, and successful emotion regulation whereas right FAA is associated with avoidance-motivation, negative emotions, and poor emotion regulation. This work has been conducted primarily in undergraduates and young adults despite the important of emotion regulation to healthy aging. The current study examined age-related differences in the relationships between emotion regulation strategy usage and resting frontal EEG asymmetry in a sample of middle-aged to older adults. We found that aging was associated with greater right FAA among both those who habitually used maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (i.e., high suppression/low reappraisal) and those who habitually used adaptive emotion regulation strategies (i.e., low suppression/high reappraisal). However, a slopes difference test revealed that aging was more strongly associated with right FAA among those who habitually used maladaptive (vs. adaptive) emotion regulation strategies. These results suggest that the negative consequences of habitually using maladaptive emotion regulation strategies may be more harmful in older adults. This may explain why some researchers have observed that older adults tend to use maladaptive emotion regulation strategies less often. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

We analyzed the relationship between everyday use of cognitive reappraisal (measured by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, ERQ-R), and the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP), which is sensitive to down-regulation of negative emotions via reappraisal. Participants viewed a series of neutral and threatening images, and rated them for level of threat. We found increased LPP amplitude for threatening compared to neutral pictures between 500 and 1,500 ms. Crucially, we found smaller LPP amplitudes to threatening versus neutral pictures for participants who used reappraisal more often in everyday life. This relationship between LPP amplitude and the ERQ-R was observed in the 1,000–1,500 ms interval of the LPP, over right centro-parietal electrodes. The current findings indicate that habitual tendency to use reappraisal is associated with reduced amplitude of the LPP in response to threatening pictures, in the absence of any explicit instruction to regulate emotions.},

The use of emotion regulation strategies can reduce the intensity of negative emotional experiences. Event related potentials (ERPs), specifically the late positive potential (LPP), are known to be sensitive to this modulation in adults. This is the first study to explore the neural correlates of expressive suppression in adolescents. We sought to replicate previous findings from emotion regulation studies with adult populations, show that the LPP can be modulated by expressive suppression in healthy adolescents, and examine the influence of age on LPP changes.
Method
ERPs of 53 healthy adolescents (12–17 years old) performing an emotion regulation task (expressive suppression) were recorded.
Results
Expressive suppression altered the LPP in adolescents with both increases and decreases noted depending on time window and recording site. The LPP during expressive suppression was decreased with increasing age.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that 1) the LPP is an effective tool to study processes associated with emotion regulation in adolescents, and 2) expressive suppression, in terms of its neural indicators, seems to become more effective with age. The nature and utility of expressive suppression as a specific form of emotion regulation in adolescents are discussed.},

The present study attempted to extend prior demonstrations of emotion regulation effects on the LPP to the domain of positively valenced stimuli. Twenty participants completed a blocked emotion regulation task: The first block consisted of passively viewing pleasant and neutral pictures, whereas the last two blocks consisted of either decreasing or increasing emotions to pleasant pictures. Results replicated our previous findings with negatively valenced stimuli, demonstrating an attenuated LPP during decrease instructions and no effect of increase instructions. Modulation of the ERP as a function of instruction was most prominent during the positive-going slow-wave time window of the LPP, indicating that attentional resources allocated to the perceptual processing of pleasant stimuli may be manipulated using emotion regulation strategies.},

Two participant groups were categorized by the Emotion Regulation-Implicit Association Test which has been used in previous research to identify two groups of participants with automatic emotion control and with automatic emotion express. The main finding was that automatic emotion express group showed a right dominance of the LPP component at posterior electrodes, especially in high arousal conditions. But no right dominance of the LPP component was observed for automatic emotion control group. We also found the group with automatic emotion control showed no differences in the right posterior LPP amplitude between high- and low-arousal emotion conditions, while the participants with automatic emotion express showed larger LPP amplitude in the right posterior in high-arousal conditions compared to low-arousal conditions. This result suggested that AER (Automatic emotion regulation) modulated the hemispheric asymmetry of LPP on posterior electrodes and supported the right hemisphere hypothesis.},

  abstract   = {Fear of snakes and spiders are common animal phobias. Emotion regulation can change the response to emotional stimuli, including snakes and spiders. It is well known that emotion regulation modulates the late positive potential (LPP), which reflects sustained motivated attention. However, research concerning the effect of emotion regulation on the early posterior negativity (EPN), which reflects early selective attention, is scarce. The present research question was whether the EPN and LPP amplitudes are modulated by regulation of emotional responses to snake and spider stimuli. Emotion up- and down-regulation were expected to enhance and reduce the LPP amplitude, respectively, but emotion regulation was not expected to modulate the EPN amplitude. Female participants passively viewed snake, spider, and bird pictures, and up- and down-regulated their emotional responses to the snake and spider pictures using self-focused reappraisal, while their electroencephalogram was recorded. There were EPNs for snakes and spiders vs. birds, as well as for snakes vs. spiders. The LPP amplitude tended to be enhanced for snakes and spiders compared to birds. Most importantly, the LPP amplitude was larger in the up-regulate than in the down-regulate condition for both snakes and spiders, but there was no evidence that the EPN amplitude was modulated by emotion regulation. This suggests that emotion regulation modulated sustained motivated attention, but not early selective attention, to snakes and spiders. The findings are in line with the notion that the emotional modulation of the EPN is more automatic than the emotional modulation of the LPP.},

In the present study, we addressed the question whether this enhanced relevance of larger (visual) stimuli might generalize to the auditory domain and whether auditory emotion effects are modulated by volume. Therefore, subjects were listening to spoken words with emotional or neutral content, played at two different volume levels, while ERPs were recorded. Negative emotional content led to an increased frontal positivity and parieto-occipital negativity – a scalp distribution similar to the EPN – between {\textasciitilde} 370 and 530 ms. Importantly, this emotion-related ERP component was not modulated by differences in volume level, which impacted early auditory processing, as reflected in increased amplitudes of the N1 (80 130 ms) and P2 (130 265 ms) components as hypothesized. However, contrary to effects of stimulus size in the visual domain, volume level did not influence later ERP components. These findings indicate modality-specific and functionally independent processing triggered by emotional content of spoken words and volume level.},

However, the impact of early visual processes on performance has been largely ignored. To clarify this issue, we explored the time-course of early visual processing (from 0 to 450 ms poststimulus) using event-related potentials topographic analyses. The main findings demonstrated a significant link between early attentional processes and accuracy scores occurring more than five seconds later, as well as a strong association between spatial covariance and microstate topographies exhibiting substantial gender differences. More specifically, the results indicated that, in a classical mental rotation task, the male brain expends more time processing visual-spatial information resulting in a longer bilateral positive potential at posterior-occipital sites. In comparison, the female brain initiates earlier processing of non-spatial information resulting in a faster transition from a bilateral positive potential of posterior-occipital sites to a negative potential at central-frontal sites. These findings illustrate how a more complete utilization of the spatiotemporal information contained in EEG recordings can provide important insights about the impact of early visual processes on interindividual differences, particularly across gender, and thus shed new light on alternate cognitive strategies.},

  abstract   = {The brain is known to be active even when not performing any overt cognitive tasks, and often it engages in involuntary mind wandering. This resting state has been extensively characterized in terms of fMRI-derived brain networks. However, an alternate method has recently gained popularity: EEG microstate analysis. Proponents of microstates postulate that the brain discontinuously switches between four quasi-stable states defined by specific EEG scalp topologies at peaks in the global field potential (GFP). These microstates are thought to be “atoms of thought,” involved with visual, auditory, salience, and attention processing. However, this method makes some major assumptions by excluding EEG data outside the GFP peaks and then clustering the EEG scalp topologies at the GFP peaks, assuming that only one microstate is active at any given time. This study explores the evidence surrounding these assumptions by studying the temporal dynamics of microstates and its clustering space using tools from dynamical systems analysis, fractal, and chaos theory to highlight the shortcomings in microstate analysis. The results show evidence of complex and chaotic EEG dynamics outside the GFP peaks, which is being missed by microstate analysis. Furthermore, the winner-takes-all approach of only one microstate being active at a time is found to be inadequate since the dynamic EEG scalp topology does not always resemble that of the assigned microstate, and there is competition among the different microstate classes. Finally, clustering space analysis shows that the four microstates do not cluster into four distinct and separable clusters. Taken collectively, these results show that the discontinuous description of EEG microstates is inadequate when looking at nonstationary short-scale EEG dynamics.},

  abstract = {Recent findings identified electroencephalography (EEG) microstates as the electrophysiological correlates of fMRI resting-state networks. Microstates are defined as short periods (100 ms) during which the EEG scalp topography remains quasi-stable; that is, the global topography is fixed but strength might vary and polarity invert. Microstates represent the subsecond coherent activation within global functional brain networks. Surprisingly, these rapidly changing EEG microstates correlate significantly with activity in fMRI resting-state networks after convolution with the hemodynamic response function that constitutes a strong temporal smoothing filter. We postulate here that microstate sequences should reveal scale-free, self-similar dynamics to explain this remarkable effect and thus that microstate time series show dependencies over long time ranges. To that aim, we deploy wavelet-based fractal analysis that allows determining scale-free behavior. We find strong statistical evidence that microstate sequences are scale free over six dyadic scales covering the 256-ms to 16-s range. The degree of long-range dependency is maintained when shuffling the local microstate labels but becomes indistinguishable from white noise when equalizing microstate durations, which indicates that temporal dynamics are their key characteristic. These results advance the understanding of temporal dynamics of brain-scale neuronal network models such as the global workspace model. Whereas microstates can be considered the “atoms of thoughts,” the shortest constituting elements of cognition, they carry a dynamic signature that is reminiscent at characteristic timescales up to multiple seconds. The scale-free dynamics of the microstates might be the basis for the rapid reorganization and adaptation of the functional networks of the brain.},

  abstract   = {In this tutorial review, we detail both the rationale for as well as the implementation of a set of analyses of surface-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) that uses the reference-free spatial (i.e. topographic) information available from high-density electrode montages to render statistical information concerning modulations in response strength, latency, and topography both between and within experimental conditions. In these and other ways these topographic analysis methods allow the experimenter to glean additional information and neurophysiologic interpretability beyond what is available from canonical waveform analyses. In this tutorial we present the example of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to stimulation of each hand to illustrate these points. For each step of these analyses, we provide the reader with both a conceptual and mathematical description of how the analysis is carried out, what it yields, and how to interpret its statistical outcome. We show that these topographic analysis methods are intuitive and easy-to-use approaches that can remove much of the guesswork often confronting ERP researchers and also assist in identifying the information contained within high-density ERP datasets.},

  abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Background:}} Age-related declines in many cognitive abilities are common in healthy aging. However, the ability to effectively regulate emotions is preserved, and possibly even enhanced, in late adulthood. This capacity has been examined most commonly in relation to low-intensity emotional stimuli that typically involve static pictures. Evidence is suggesting that older adults may become overwhelmed when exposed to emotional cues of heightened intensity. \textbf{\textit{Objective:}} In the current study, we assessed whether older adults retain the ability to regulate emotions successfully when exposed to more emotionally evocative (e.g., dynamic) stimuli. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Young and older adults were instructed to regulate, using expressive suppression, their outward behavioral expression of emotions while viewing dynamic stimuli involving amusing and sad films. Facial reactivity, as indexed using electromyography, self-rated emotional experience, and memory for the stimuli were assessed. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} The results showed that, relative to young adults, older adults were unable to suppress \textit{zygomaticus} (cheek) activity to amusing films or \textit{corrugator} (brow) reactivity to sad films, which is likely due to their relatively reduced facial muscle reactivity. Expressive suppression did not affect young or older adults’ subjective feelings or memory for the stimuli. \textbf{\textit{Conclusion:}} Our findings suggest that there are age differences in facial muscle reactivity to amusing and sad cues of heightened intensity. These findings suggest that older adults’ ability to effectively regulate emotions may be limited, at least with expressive suppression, in the context of high-intensity emotional cues. Further research is needed to investigate possible exceptions the preservation of emotion regulation in older adults.},

inferences. Of note, many studies, as those published in this Journal, report association of gene(s) at the genomic and
transcriptomic levels by undertaking appropriate statistical tests. For instance, genotype, allele or haplotype frequencies at
the genomic level or normalized expression levels at the transcriptomic level are compared between the case and control
groups using the Chi-square/Fisher’s exact test or independent (i.e. two-sampled) t-test respectively, with this culminating into
a single numeric, namely the P value (or the degree of the false positive rate), which is used to make or break the outcome of
the association test. This approach has flaws but nevertheless remains a standard and convenient approach in association
studies. However, what becomes a critical issue is that the same cut-off is used when ‘multiple’ tests are undertaken on the
same case-control (or any pairwise) comparison. Here, in brevity, we present what the P value represents, and why and when
it should be adjusted. We also show, with worked examples, how to adjust P values for multiple testing in the R environment

Compared with the control condition, both reappraisal and suppression were effective in reducing emotion-expressive behavior. However, reappraisal decreased disgust experience, whereas suppression increased sympathetic activation.

Because a discussion of emotion regulation presupposes an understanding of what emotion is, we first consider emotion in the context of the larger family of affective processes to which it belongs. Next, we distinguish emotion regulation from other major forms of self-regulation. This prepares the way for our presentation of the framework we use to organize the many different types of emotion regulation. Using this framework, we review findings from child developmental and adult literatures. In the last section, we highlight some of the biggest challenges--and opportunities--for those interested in emotion and emotion regulation.  Topics include: emotions and related processes (core features of emotion, the modal model of emotion), emotion regulation and related processes (core features of emotion regulation, emotion regulation and related constructs), emotion regulation strategies (situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, response modulation), and elaborations and complications (time and feedback, antecedent-focused versus response-focused regulation, from one process to many).

Startle demonstrated diminished sensitivity to the regulation instructions across assessments and poor reliability.

Using a trait-like psychophysiological measure of emotion regulation, corrugator electromyography, we obtained an objective index of the ability to cognitively reappraise negative emotion in 56 healthy men (Session 1). who returned 13 years later to perform the same regulation task using fMRI (Session 2). Results indicated that the corrugator measure of regulatory skill predicted amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity. Individuals with greater ability to down-regulate negative emotion as indexed by corrugator at Session 1 showed not only greater amygdala attenuation but also greater inverse connectivity between the amygdala and several sectors of the prefrontal cortex while down-regulating negative emotion at Session 2. Our results demonstrate that individual differences in emotion regulation are stable over time and underscore the important role of amygdala-prefrontal coupling for successful regulation of negative emotion.

Men and women viewed emotionally negative pictures while they attempted to either increase or decrease negative emotions elicited by the pictures, or to simply view the pictures. Neutral pictures were also presented with instructions to simply view the pictures. Concurrent changes in emotional arousal and valence were assessed with skin conductance responses (SCRs) and facial corrugator electromyographic responses (EMG), respectively. Picture memory was assessed with an immediate recall test and a delayed recognition test Relative to simply viewing pictures, voluntary reappraisal to increase negative emotion generated greater facial corrugator EMG and SCR responses, and reappraisal to decrease negative emotion generated decreased corrugator EMG responses. Men showed enhanced recognition for pictures presented during the increase and decrease conditions, whereas women showed comparable recognition performance across all regulation conditions. The modulation of subsequent recognition memory associated with decreasing emotion was inversely associated with changes in physiological responses. Our results suggest that sex is an important factor to consider in determining how reappraisal-induced physiological changes are associated with subsequent changes in memory. These findings contribute to our understanding of how reappraising emotion exerts both immediate and enduring influences on physiological responses and subsequent memory. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

While an important aspect of successful regulation, few studies have assessed it experimentally. Those that have typically prime reappraisal and compare this strategy to explicit reappraisal or a control. The current study introduced a novel paradigm to assess implicit use of reappraisal or suppression. Specifically, we used a cognitive bias modification task to evaluate differences in implicit emotion regulation strategy selection. This resulted in roughly half of the participants tending toward choosing predominantly reappraisal words (High Reappraisers) and half choosing equal numbers of reappraisal and suppression words (Flexible Regulators). The possibility that this reflected implicit regulation style was further supported by significant relationships between implicit regulation choice and self-reported use of strategies. Contrary to hypotheses, implicit regulation style did not affect self-reported emotions following the distress task. Still, those scoring high in implicit reappraisal reported fewer difficulties in overall emotion regulation. These findings highlight the utility of a behavioral measure to capture variations in implicit emotion regulation style to better understand the context and factors that are most effective for emotion regulation more generally.},

In the current study, two bipolar facial electromyography (EMG) channels over corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major were employed for differentiating various emotional states in two dimensions of valence (negative, neutral and positive) and arousal (high and low) while participants looked at affective visual stimuli. The results demonstrated that corrugator EMG and zygomaticus EMG efficiently differentiated negative and positive emotions from others, respectively. Moreover, corrugator EMG discriminated emotions on valence clearly, whereas zygomaticus EMG was ambiguous in neutral and negative emotional states. However, there was no significant statistical evidence for the discrimination of facial EMG responses in the dimension of arousal. Furthermore, correlation analysis proved significant correlations between facial EMG activities and ratings of valence performed by participants and other samples, which strongly supported the consistency of facial EMG reactions and subjective emotional experiences. In addition, the repeatability of facial EMG indicated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were provided, in which corrugator EMG held an excellent level of repeatability, and zygomaticus EMG grasped only a poor level of repeatability. Considering these results, facial EMG is reliable and effective to identify negative and positive emotional experiences elicited by affective visual stimuli, which may offer us an alternative method in building a basis for automated classification of users' affective states in various situations.},

This randomized trial examined changes in processing speed and processing speed-related neural activity in older participants (57-71 years of age) who underwent cognitive training (CT, N = 12) compared with wait-listed (WLC, N = 15) or exercise-training active (AC, N = 14) controls. The cognitive training taught cognitive control functions of strategic attention, integrative reasoning, and innovation over 12 weeks. All 3 groups worked through a functional magnetic resonance imaging processing speed task during 3 sessions (baseline, mid-training, and post-training). Although all groups showed faster reaction times (RTs) across sessions, the CT group showed a significant increase, and the WLC and AC groups showed significant decreases across sessions in the association between RT and BOLD signal change within the left prefrontal cortex (PFC). Thus, cognitive training led to a change in processing speed-related neural activity where faster processing speed was associated with reduced PFC activation, fitting previously identified neural efficiency profiles.

  abstract = {Background: Both cognitive and physical exercise have been discussed as promising interventions for healthy cognitive aging. The present study assessed the effects of cognitive training (spatial vs. perceptual training) and physical training (endurance training vs. non-endurance training) on spatial learning and associated brain activation in 33 adults (40-55 years). Spatial learning was assessed with a virtual maze task, and at the same time neural correlates were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results: Only the spatial training improved performance in the maze task. These behavioral gains were accompanied by a decrease in frontal and temporal lobe activity. At posttest, participants of the spatial training group showed lower activity than participants of the perceptual training group in a network of brain regions associated with spatial learning, including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. No significant differences were observed between the two physical intervention groups. Conclusions: Functional changes in neural systems associated with spatial navigation can be induced by cognitive interventions and seem to be stronger than effects of physical exercise in middle-aged adults.},

Although its efficacy is well established, the neural mechanisms underlying this intervention are unknown. This pilot study used functional MRI (fMRI) to explore neural changes following UFOVt. Method: Task-driven and resting-state fMRI were used to examine changes in brain activity and connectivity in healthy older adults randomized to 10 hr of UFOVt (n = 13), 10 hr of cognitively stimulating activities (CSA; n = 11), or a no-contact control (NC; n = 10). Results: UFOVt resulted in reduced task-driven activity in the majority of regions of interest (ROIs) associated with task performance, CSA resulted in reduced activity in one ROI, and there were no changes within the NC group. Relative to NC, UFOVt reduced activity in ROIs involved in effortful information processing. There were no other significant between group task-based differences. Resting-state functional connectivity between ROIs involved in executive function and visual attention was strengthened following UFOVt compared with CSA and NC. Discussion: UFOVt enhances connections needed for visual attention. Together with prior work, this study provides evidence that improvement of the brain's visual attention efficiency is one mechanism underlying UFOVt.},

In the present review it has been addressed the issue of whether some forms of emotion regulation are healthier than others by focusing on two commonly used emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal (changing the way one thinks about potentially emotion-eliciting events) and expressive suppression (changing the way one behaviorally responds to emotion-eliciting events). In the first section, experimental findings showing that cognitive reappraisal has a healthier profile of short-term affective, cognitive, and social consequences than expressive suppression are briefly reported. In the second section, individual-difference findings are reviewed showing that using cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions is associated with healthier patterns of affect, social functioning, and well-being than is using expressive suppression. Finally, brain structural basis and functional activation linked to the habitual usage of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression are discussed in detail.},

  abstract   = {One critical developmental milestone is the ability to employ strategies that will regulate unruly emotions [1]. In childhood, and adulthood, emotions do not always need to be controlled, but in situations where regulating them is adaptive, such as educational settings, there are many strategies available for use. One commonly used and largely adaptive strategy is cognitive reappraisal, which involves changing the way we are thinking about a situation in order to change how we feel. Research indicates that this strategy is generally more adaptive than other strategies, such as expressive suppression (in Western cultures) and under certain circumstances, distraction. However, there are some situations in which using reappraisal might not be the best choice, including using reappraisal to regulate emotions which are strong, immediate, perceptually-based, or emotions that are the result of situations that are still controllable. Future work should continue to explore the contextual conditions that inform when reappraisal is effective and adaptive, and define the best alternate strategies when reappraisal cannot be effective and adaptive.},

Recorded in parallel sessions, the slow-wave late positive potential (LPP) and visual cortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were both modulated by the rated intensity of picture arousal. The amplitude of the LPP correlated significantly with BOLD intensity in lateral occipital, inferotemporal, and parietal visual areas across picture contents. Estimated strength of modeled regional sources did not correlate significantly with regional BOLD intensity. These data suggest that the enhanced positive slow wave seen over posterior sites during emotional picture processing represents activity in a circuit of visual cortical structures, reflecting a perceptual sensitivity to the motivational relevance of visual scenes.

Generation of the Ne/ERN has been associated with structures in the prefrontal cortex, especially the anterior cingulate region, but also the supplementary motor cortex and subcortical structures. There is some controversy as to whether the Ne/ERN is a necessary concomitant to error detection. We examined the Ne/ERN in five patients with damage to the medial prefrontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate region. Our findings support the implication of the rostral anterior cingulate in Ne/ERN production, but they also show that subjects can be aware of errors and yet not produce an Ne/ERN. Thus, error detection leads to the Ne/ERN process and damage to the anterior cingulate region may interrupt this relay, suggesting that error detection may be supported by circuits outside the anterior cingulate region.},

Upright fearful faces elicited a frontocentral positivity within 120 ms after stimulus presentation, which was followed by a broadly distributed sustained positivity beyond 250 ms post-stimulus. Emotional expression effects were delayed and attenuated when faces were inverted. In contrast, the face-specific N170 component was completely unaffected by facial expression. We conclude that emotional expression analysis and the structural encoding of faces are parallel processes. Early emotional ERP modulations may reflect the rapid activation of prefrontal areas involved in the analysis of facial expression.},

Yet it remains unknown how these value representations are computed from sensory and memory representations in more posterior brain regions. We used electroencephalography (EEG) while subjects evaluated appetitive and aversive food items to study how event-related responses modulated by stimulus value evolve over time. We found that value-related activity shifted from posterior to anterior, and from parietal to central to frontal sensors, across three major time windows after stimulus onset: 150–250 ms, 400–550 ms, and 700–800 ms. Exploratory localization of the EEG signal revealed a shifting network of activity moving from sensory and memory structures to areas associated with value coding, with stimulus value activity localized to vmPFC only from 400 ms onwards. Consistent with these results, functional connectivity analyses also showed a causal flow of information from temporal cortex to vmPFC. Thus, although value signals are present as early as 150 ms after stimulus onset, the value signals in vmPFC appear relatively late in the choice process, and seem to reflect the integration of incoming information from sensory and memory related regions.},

This effect has been difficult to demonstrate in the domain of real (non-hypothetical) effort investment, and this may be due in part to individual differences in the decision processes. We designed a decision-making task, where a cognitive effort investment is required to enact a strategy, to examine the extent to which individual differences in Need for Cognition (NFC), Lack of Premeditation, and subjective effort perception bear upon decisions to persist with a suboptimal strategy under varying levels of effort investment and opportunity cost-i.e. the difference in utility between persisting with versus switching strategies. We found that NFC and (Lack of) Premeditation predicted the extent to which strategy switch decisions were driven by opportunity costs. While we did not find an overall effect of past behavioral investment effect, self-reported effort (Temporal Demand) appeared to predict susceptibility to sunk cost. We also found a decrease in decision times with increasing sunk costs, but this effect did not appear to differ as a function of the individual differences examined.},

Across both studies, nudge effectiveness was partially impacted by Need for Cognition and not impacted at all by Need for Uniqueness.

  abstract = {Background Findings on the association between health literacy and anti-retroviral (ARV) adherence are inconsistent. Health literacy is usually operationalized with simple tests of basic literacy, but more complex conceptions of health literacy include content knowledge. People living with chronic illness also conceptualize and experience illness in ways other than biomedical or mechanistic models of disease. Objective There are no instruments that comprehensively assess knowledge of people living with HIV concerning HIV disease and treatment; or psychological adjustment to being HIV+. Little is known about the relationship between factual knowledge, or positive identification as HIV+, and anti-retroviral (ARV) adherence. Methods Formative work with in-depth semi-structured interviews, and cognitive testing, to develop a structured instrument assessing HIV-related knowledge, and personal meanings of living with HIV. Pilot administration of the instrument to a convenience sample of 101 respondents. Key results Respondents varied considerably in their expressed need for in-depth knowledge, the accuracy of their understanding of relevant scientific concepts and facts about ARV treatment, and psychological adjustment and acceptance of HIV+ status. Most knowledge domains were not significantly related to self-reported ARV adherence, but accurate knowledge specifically about ARV treatment was (r = 0.25, p = .02), as was an adapted version of the Need for Cognition scale (r = .256, p = .012). Negative feelings about living with HIV (r = .33, p = .0012), and medication taking (r = .276, p = .008) were significantly associated with non-adherence. Conclusion The instrument may be useful in diagnosing addressable reasons for non-adherence, as a component of psychoeducational interventions, and for evaluation of such interventions.},

Email and phone call usage were contributing nonsignificant negative predictors.

We assessed mental health, relationship orientation, marginalized identities (i.e., sexual orientation minority, gender minority, racial minority, ethnic minority, and lower education), and preferences in information processing (PIP) as factors differentiating lifetime SRB groups. An online cross-sectional survey study was conducted in 2018. Members of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF; n = 334) took part. Bivariate analyses identified the following SRB risk factors: female and transgender/gender non-binary identity, sexual orientation minority identity, lower education, suicide attempt/death exposure, Need for Affect (NFA) Avoidance, depression, and anxiety. Monogamous relationship orientation was a protective factor. Multi-nomial regression revealed the following: (1) monogamous relationship orientation was a protective factor for suicidal ideation and attempt; (2) lower education was a risk factor for suicide attempt; (3) anxiety was a risk factor for suicide attempt; and (4) depression was a risk factor for suicidal ideation. A two-way interaction showed that elevated NFA Approach buffered the negative impacts of depression. Relationship orientation, several marginalized identities (i.e., based on gender, sexual orientation, and educational level), and PIP all contributed uniquely to SRB. Further study is necessary to understand the role of relationship orientation with suicide. Health education and suicide prevention efforts with NCSF should be tailored to account for marginalized identity, mental health, and NFA factors.},

Of the latter, we focus on tie strength, a central component of social networking sites, which has an important role in information flow, and the role of which in the process of message credibility assessment has been so far overlooked. We also consider two important and relevant meta-cognitive measures: need for cognition and expertise perception. Applying an experimental design in Facebook (N = 324), our findings suggest that need for cognition weakens the positive associations between tie strength and perceived message credibility. Also, both expertise perception and tie strength have positive effect on perceived message credibility.},

The Cognitive Reconstruction of Knowledge Model emphasizes the importance of conceptual dissatisfaction, topic interest, and learners' need for cognition in the process of conceptual change. However, most conceptual change studies have failed to differentiate the contribution of dispositional and situational interest to the revision of conceptual understanding. The current study was designed to test key predictions of the Cognitive Reconstruction of Knowledge Model while also exploring the influence of dispositional and situational interest on the conceptual change process. Participants (N = 360) recruited from two universities in the United States completed measures assessing pre- and post-test knowledge, individual and situational interest, need for cognition, dissatisfaction, and cognitive engagement. Further, participants read a refutational text designed to address commonly endorsed misconceptions regarding HIV/AIDS. Results of a path analysis indicated situational interest exerted a significant indirect effect on conceptual change scores through cognitive engagement. Contrary to the predictions of the Cognitive Reconstruction of Knowledge Model, our findings indicated that the need for cognition, individual interest, and cognitive conflict were not significant predictors of conceptual change. We believe the findings of our investigation highlight the importance of fostering situational interest when attempting to promote knowledge reconstruction among learners.},

Very few studies, however, report sample size calculations or even the information needed to accurately calculate sample sizes for grants and future research. We systematically reviewed 100 randomly selected clinical human electrophysiology studies from six high impact journals that frequently publish electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) research to determine the proportion of studies that reported sample size calculations, as well as the proportion of studies reporting the necessary components to complete such calculations. Studies were coded by the two authors blinded to the other's results. Inter-rater reliability was 100\% for the sample size calculations and kappa above 0.82 for all other variables. Zero of the 100 studies (0\%) reported sample size calculations. 77\% utilized repeated-measures designs, yet zero studies (0\%) reported the necessary variances and correlations among repeated measures to accurately calculate future sample sizes. Most studies (93\%) reported study statistical values (e.g., F or t values). Only 40\% reported effect sizes, 56\% reported mean values, and 47\% reported indices of variance (e.g., standard deviations/standard errors). Absence of such information hinders accurate determination of sample sizes for study design, grant applications, and meta-analyses of research and whether studies were adequately powered to detect effects of interest. Increased focus on sample size calculations, utilization of registered reports, and presenting information detailing sample size calculations and statistics for future researchers are needed and will increase sample size-related scientific rigor in human electrophysiology research.},

Objective
The aim of this study was to determine whether PTSD patients without re-exposure to accident-related stimuli would exhibit alterations in cerebral perfusion compared with age-matched normal subjects.
Methods
Brain perfusion SPECT was measured in medication-free 23 PTSD patients and 64 age-matched healthy subjects under resting conditions and analyzed using statistical parametric mapping to compare between the patient and control groups.
Results
We found that PTSD patients exhibited increased cerebral blood perfusion in limbic regions and decreased perfusion in the superior frontal gyrus and parietal and temporal regions in comparison with those of the normal controls.
Conclusions
This result indicates that PTSD patients have alterations in cerebral perfusion of limbic regions and the frontal and temporal cortex without re-exposure to accident-related stimuli.
Significance
This finding supports the hypothesis of the involvement of limbic regions, which might be associated with the regulation of emotion and memory, in the pathophysiology of PTSD.},

ERT is an adaptation of the Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) programme. This paper describes the background of the programme, and gives an outline of the treatment programme. The effectiveness of ERT was examined in a randomized controlled pilot study with 43 youth (aged 14–19 years) in five mental health centres in the Netherlands. Subjects were assessed before and after random assignment to ERT plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 23) or to TAU alone (n = 20). Outcome measures included assessment of BPD symptoms, locus of control, and internalizing and externalizing behaviour. Both groups showed equal reductions in BPD symptoms over time. The group receiving ERT plus TAU (and not the TAU-only group) had a significant increase in internal locus of control: ERT participants reported more sense of control over their own mood swings, and attributed changes in mood swings not only to external factors. The study was complicated by a high attrition. The implications of the findings are discussed, including the difficulties inherent in treating and researching an adolescent population, and the need for researchers to develop age-appropriate assessments. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: • There is a clear need for the recognition of BPD symptoms in adolescents. • Early interventions could alleviate the symptoms of BPD, and prevent the development of full-blown BPD and poor psychosocial outcome. • ERT is a 17-session adjunctive group programme for adolescents with BPD symptoms that improves internal locus of control. • ERT shows equal results on BPD symptoms as treatment as usual. • The attrition rate in this study was high; this finding is similar to other studies with BPD patients.},

The authors argue that attention may be an invaluable tool for promoting emotion regulation. Accordingly, they present evidence that selective attention to positive information reflects emotion regulation and that regulating attention is a critical component of the emotion regulatory process. Furthermore, attentional regulation can be successfully trained through repeated practice. The authors ultimately propose a model of attention training methodologies integrating attention-dependent emotion regulation strategies with attention networks. Although additional interdisciplinary research is needed to bolster these nascent findings, meditative practices appear to be among the most effective training methodologies in enhancing emotional well-being. Further exploration of the positive and therapeutic qualities of attention warrants the empirical attention of social and personality psychologists.},

Expanding on the presumed involvement of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) in persuasion, we hypothesized that the vMPFC contributes to the evaluation of persuasive information depending on its match with the recipient's affective or cognitive predominance. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 30 participants evaluated 10 consumable products presented with both affective and cognitive persuasive messages. All participants were characterized on a continuum regarding their personal orientation in terms of individual differences in need for affect (NFA) and need for cognition (NFC). The results showed that the vMPFC, posterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum are more strongly activated when the persuasive message content, either affective or cognitive, matched the recipient's individual affective or cognitive orientation. Interestingly, this effect in the vMPFC was found specifically when participants evaluated the products presented by the persuasive messages, whereas the correlation in the posterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum activity was detected when reading the messages. These results confirm the hypothesis that the vMPFC plays a role in subjectively weighting persuasive message content depending on individual differences in affective and cognitive orientation. Such a structural matching effect might involve the vMPFC particularly during explicit expressions of subjective valuations. These novel findings also further develop the conceptualization of the role of the vMPFC in self-related processing.},

  abstract   = {How do humans make choices between different types of rewards? Economists have long argued on theoretical grounds that humans typically make these choices as if the values of the options they consider have been mapped to a single common scale for comparison. Neuroimaging studies in humans have recently begun to suggest the existence of a small group of specific brain sites that appear to encode the subjective values of different types of rewards on a neural common scale, almost exactly as predicted by theory. We have conducted a meta analysis using data from thirteen different functional magnetic resonance imaging studies published in recent years and we show that the principle brain area associated with this common representation is a subregion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The data available today suggest that this common valuation path is a core system that participates in day-to-day decision making suggesting both a neurobiological foundation for standard economic theory and a tool for measuring preferences neurobiologically. Perhaps even more exciting is the possibility that our emerging understanding of the neural mechanisms for valuation and choice may provide fundamental insights into pathological choice behaviors like addiction, obesity and gambling.},

  abstract = {Neuroscience has increasingly explored the neural mechanisms underlying our sense of self. Recent studies have demonstrated the recruitment of regions like the ventral tegmental area, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the ventral striatum to self-specific stimuli—regions typically associated with reward-related processing. This raises the question of whether there is a relationship between self and reward and, if so, how these different fields can be linked. Three relationship models that aim to explore the relationship between self and reward are discussed here: integration, segregation, and parallel processing. Their pros and cons are reviewed in light of the most recent findings. The conclusion is that both the fields of self and reward may benefit from increased interaction. This interaction may help to fill in some of the missing pieces regarding reward-related processing, as well as illuminate how brain function can bring forward the philosophical concept and psychological reality of self.},

IH was associated with less claiming of knowledge one doesn't have, indicating a more accurate assessment of one's knowledge. However, IH was also associated with underestimating one's cognitive ability. The differences may have resulted from using multiple measures of IH, each tapping unique aspects of the construct. Finally, IH was associated with a variety of characteristics associated with knowledge acquisition, including reflective thinking, need for cognition, intellectual engagement, curiosity, intellectual openness, and open-minded thinking. IH was also associated with less social vigilantism, which may promote collaborative learning. Finally, IH was associated with an intrinsic motivation to learn.

  abstract   = {Media multitasking has become an inseparable part of the media routine for many Internet users as it is being retribalized, as a multisensory computer-mediated behavior, in the mobile media age. Guided by McLuhan's media ecology theory, this study examined the hierarchical relationships between media multitasking and media generations, mobile media use, and need for cognition among users in the United States and China (N = 1,340). After gender was controlled, media generations (defined as those growing up with or without the pervasive use of mobile media) was directly associated with media multitasking. Moreover, mobile media power use mediated the relationship between media generations and media multitasking. The personality construct of need for cognition was also found to play a critical role in performing multitasking. These findings indicate that mobile media technologies are reactivating multiple human senses in multitaskers, which might be a result of the evolutionary process spearheaded by the ubiquity of mobile media technologies. Thus, it is high time to revisit media multitasking as a new normal and access it as a multisensory behavior. McLuhan's media ecology theory helps understand the evolution of media multitasking, which may no longer be as simple as a technology distraction to users.},

In this preregistered study, we tested whether these associations are mediated by need for cognition-the extent to which one tends towards, and enjoys, analytical thought. In a large sample of young adults (N = 463, M-age = 19.7 years), we tested whether need for cognition mediated the association between self-reported ADHD symptoms on the one hand and decision-making strategy complexity on an experimental gambling task and self-reported real-life RTB on the other hand. Preregistered confirmatory analyses indicated first that ADHD symptoms were positively associated with real-life RTB, but the association was not mediated by need for cognition. Second, ADHD symptoms were not related to decision-making strategy complexity, and need for cognition was not a significant mediator. Explorative analyses revealed that (a) need for cognition was associated with higher decision-making accuracy and slower reaction time; (b) need for cognition was related to inattentive but not to hyperactive/impulsive ADHD symptoms; (c) need for cognition was associated with health-related RTB but not interpersonal RTB; and (4) only the association between inattention and health-related RTB was mediated by need for cognition. We conclude that need for cognition is not a mediator in the association between ADHD symptoms and RTB. Additionally, we conclude that neither ADHD symptoms nor need for cognition predict decision-making strategy complexity. Implications for both future research and clinical practice are discussed.},

This work intends to demonstrate that retailers, through the management of in-store marketing levers, can influence shopping behaviour, no matter which is the individual tendency to engage in cognitive behaviours. For this specific purpose, we have considered participants' "Need for Cognition" as a proxy of self-control. Design/methodology/approach With reference to a specific category (cookies), we created a new display based on benefits (healthy eating) rather than products' attributes. A pre-test was conducted before the main experiment in order to assess the potential ability of the new nutritional display to help customers selecting healthier products, by testing participants' awareness and comprehension of the stimuli proposed. Then, an online between-subjects experiment was conducted by simulating the shoppers' expedition in the cookies' aisle inside a store with the aim to demonstrate that healthy choices can be also made on impulse. Findings Our findings showed that when both communication and visual cues are provided, people low in need for cognition (NFC) are more willing to select healthy products from the shelf, compared with people high in NFC. Originality/value While there is a wide literature explaining the mechanisms supporting healthy choices, fewer are the contributions about the role of retailers in promoting healthy eating through in-store marketing levers. More important, there is no contribution about how to promote health among people with low level of self-control.},

Hence, we conducted an experiment (N = 294) to investigate effects of message factors and individual differences on individuals' credibility and accuracy perceptions of disinformation as well as on their likelihood of sharing them. Results suggest that message factors, such as the source, inconsistencies, subjectivity, sensationalism, or manipulated images, seem less important for users' evaluations of disinformation articles than individual differences. While need for cognition seems most relevant for accuracy perceptions, the opinion toward the news topic seems most crucial for whether people believe in the news and share it online.},

  abstract   = {Decisions vary. They may vary in both content and complexity. People also vary. An important way that people vary is how much they think. Some prior research investigating thinking and decision making largely conflicts with most traditional decision theories. For example, if considering an array of products to choose from, thinking more about the alternative's attributes should lead to a better decision. However, some research indicates that thinking more may also lead to focusing on irrelevant aspects of the decision and a less optimal outcome. We propose that this conflict in the literature exists because of a failure to consider the interaction between the individual and the decision task. To test this, we used separate methodologies that enhance or attenuate a person's thinking. In Study 1, we selected people who were especially high or low in need for cognition and had them complete a robust decision-making inventory, which included both complex and simple tasks. In Study 2, we manipulated participant's level of glucose, which acts as the brain's fuel to enhance or attenuate thinking ability. Both studies provide insight for understanding our central tenant that more thought leads to better decisions in complex tasks but does not influence simple decisions. These findings show how the individual's thinking can interact with the constructive elements of the task to shape decision choice.},

Extant research on viral advertising has focused mostly on evaluating content characteristics as drivers of virality, but very few studies have examined the potential influence of consumers' personality variables that affect their information processing and subsequent ad-sharing behavior. By taking a consumer-centric approach, two experimental studies were conducted to examine how consumer's need for cognition (NFC: high vs. low) interacts with message appeal (emotional vs. informational) used in the branded viral advertisements and extent of brand information (high vs. low brand prominence) present in the branded viral advertisement to influence consumers' intentions to share viral advertisements. As compared with low-NFC individuals, high-NFC individuals reported higher sharing intentions for viral ads that use informational appeal and also for an emotional viral ad where brand prominence is high. This finding is consistent with the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). Further, the results of these studies show an interesting finding that contradicts the existing understanding originating from ELM; that is, high-NFC individuals reported higher sharing intentions for viral ads with an emotional appeal as compared with low-NFC individuals, even when the brand prominence is low. Possible explanations and implications of the findings are discussed in this paper.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of these personality traits as resilience or risk factors, respectively, in diabetes self-management and glycaemic control. Further, it was examined whether diabetes-specific self-efficacy could serve as a mediator of these relationships. Design/Measures Data of 77 participants with type 2 diabetes was ascertained, using self-report instruments for NFC, impulsivity, diabetes-specific self-efficacy, and diabetes self-management. Glycemic control was assessed by the biomarker HbA(1c). Results While NFC was strongly positively associated with diabetes self-management and glycemic control, impulsivity showed a reverse pattern. Results of simple and serial mediation models showed that the effects on diabetes self-management and HbA(1c) of both, impulsivity and NFC, were mediated by self-efficacy. Conclusion The moderate to high standardized coefficients suggests that NFC might be an important protective factor and impulsivity a possible risk factor for effective diabetes self-management and glycemic control. These traits could be applied for an easy-to-use questionnaire-based patient screening, enabling trait-tailored treatments and programs which in turn may lower economic and health costs associated with poor diabetes-care.},

Results: As in the original proposal of the emotional gratification scale, the following dimensions were identified: fun, thrill, empathic sadness, release of emotions, social sharing, contemplative experiences, and character engagement, with acceptable model fit and reliability, convergent and divergent validity. Social sharing, contemplate experiences, need for affect and age were significant predictors of movie recommendation; whereas social sharing, thrill, extraversion, and age contributed most to explaining rewatching interest. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of considering distinct gratifications and individual differences in predicting rewatching and movie recommendation.},

  abstract = {There exists a large body of literature seeking to understand the relation between math anxiety and success in mathematics. While most of this literature focuses on domain specific relations (i.e., how math anxiety impacts thinking about mathematics), in the current work we examine important relations between math anxiety and domain general factors. Specifically, we test three hypotheses: (1) that higher-math-anxious individuals have a lower need for and enjoyment of exerting cognitive effort, (2) that math anxiety mediates a relation between ones' propensity for cognitive effort and their achievement in mathematics, and (3) that higher-math-anxious individuals are less reflective in their thinking, and that this is not limited to questions that are heavily reliant on mathematical reasoning. As predicted, we uncovered relations between math anxiety and the domain-general constructs of need for cognition and cognitive reflection. Importantly, these negative relations hold even after controlling for math ability, general anxiety, and gender of the participant. The results are discussed in terms of implications for our understanding of the construct of math anxiety. Proficiency in mathematics is a major advantage in industrialised nations. Unfortunately, many people experience math-anxiety (Richardson \& Suinn, 1972), becoming nervous when engaging in math tasks and avoiding math and math-related professions. As a result, those with math anxiety tend to severely limit their future career and earning opportunities (Chipman, Krantz, \& Silver, 1992; Hembree, 1990). The resulting shortage of adults prepared to work in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics field (STEM) has negative consequences at the national level, particularity as societies become increasingly dependent upon technology (Beilock \& Maloney, 2015; Chipman et al., 1992; Maloney \& Beilock, 2012). Worldwide, increased math-anxiety is linked to decreased math achievement (Foley et al., 2017; Lee, 2009), and this is not limited to academic situations. Math-anxious nurses, for example, are more likely than non-mathanxious nurses to make poor drug calculations (Mcmullan, Jones, \& Lea, 2012); math-anxious women are more likely than their peers to engage in poor financial planning (McKenna \& Nickols, 1988), and math anxiety is negatively linked to the ability to interpret health statistics (Silk \& Parrott, 2014). Given that math-anxiety is related to important and detrimental consequences in people's daily lives, it is vital that we work to understand the behavioural and cognitive differences between those who are high and low in math-anxiety.},

Nineteen values of the Schwartz Personal Values Questionnaire and the score of Need for Cognition Scale (Russian version by E. Shepeleva and E. Lapteva) were used as measures. Sample consisted of the two groups: 80 school students parented in families in Orel, age M = 16.3 years old and 39 children raised in orphan asylums from various cities of Russia, age M = 14.4. Children parented in families had higher scores for the individual values of Self-Direction Freedom of Thought and Self-Direction Actions, Stimulation, Achievement, Face, Benevolence Care and Benevolence Dependability. Children raised in orphan asylums had higher scores for the values of Hedonism, Tradition, Safety Personal, Conformity Rules and Humility. On the general level children from families reported higher Openness to changes value and children from the orphan asylums reported higher Conservatism values. Values related to Openness to Changes are known as positive predictors of the social-personal capital of an individual (A. Tatarko), while values of the Conservatism are negatively related to the socialpersonal capital. Additionally we extracted the data from a subsample of the second group: 29 children taking individual internet lessons for the general education program additionally to the main education course, age M = 14.6. We compared their data with the data of children parented in families. Children raised in orphan asylums taking individual internet lessons did not differ from children parented in families in scores for values of Self-Direction Freedom of Thought, Stimulation and Benevolence Care, and had higher scores as a second group in whole and plus for the value of Universalism-Nature. Thus some values less reported in the group of children raised in orphan asylums did not differ between children taking individual lessons and children parented in families. In terms of social-personal capital it means that children raised in orphan asylums have similar level of this capital as children parented in families. The design of our study does not allow us to make a causal conclusion that individual lessons created this value level. We still may consider the alternative hypothesis that this effect is due to the self-selection effect, as children were free to take part in educational program and their different values might influence their choice. Nonetheless our results should be understood in the context that the need for cognition score was always higher for the family group than for groups from orphan asylums.},

In this article, we present findings from a study that investigated the depth to which participants (n = 90) from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds (the UK, Spain, and China) were found to process 30 real-world adverts featuring creative metaphor and metonymy in multimodal format. We focus on the cross-cultural variation in terms of time taken to process, appreciation and perceived effectiveness of adverts, and on individual differences explained by different levels of need for cognition. We found significant variation in the understanding of advertisements containing metaphor, metonymy, and combinations of the two, between subjects and across nationalities in terms of (i) processing time, (ii) overall appeal, and (iii) the way in which participants interpreted the advertisements.},

However, it is unclear whether people's motivation to cognitively engage with the counter-stereotypical information (i.e., need for cognition [NFC]) influences this effect. Across three experiments (N = 887) we found consistent support for the idea that exposure to counter-stereotypes (CSTs) promotes cognitive reflection for people low in NFC (d(+) = .34). In contrast, people high in NFC showed decreased cognitive reflection after being exposed to CSTs (d(+) = -.18), although the evidence for the latter effect was weak. These findings suggest that exposure to CSTs can promote cognitive reflection unless people have a strong desire to understand and predict outcomes and events, in which case exposure to CSTs may backfire. Taken together, we conclude that motivation to engage in cognitive activity may be an important consideration for research and interventions involving social and cultural diversity.},

This paper explores this possible relation. A nationally representative sample of adults (N = 1005) recruited from an internet panel were surveyed about lay risk beliefs and risk perceptions regarding diabetes and colorectal cancer, psychosocial factors (i.e., health literacy, need for cognition, locus of control), demographics, and current health behaviors (i.e., cigarette smoking, red meat intake, physical activity). In separate sets of regressions controlling for either demographics, psychosocial factors, or risk perceptions, lay risk beliefs remained significantly related to health behaviors. It may be important to consider how to address lay risk beliefs in intervention content and targeting in order to increase adaptive health behaviors and thereby prevent chronic disease.},

Structural equation modeling of data from a representative survey of 2,273 adolescents, aged 13 to 17, provide support for the theorized model, such that concept-oriented communication within families is associated to news exposure indirectly, via personality traits and motivations. Thus, the study provides an initial assessment of one way children are socialized to become news enthusiasts and news avoiders. It also provides empirical evidence that information-processing traits are influenced by family communication patterns, confirming what hitherto was theoretical speculation.},

Utilizing age as an instrumental variable, we analyzed data from 8,824 respondents (mean age = 49.43) to the 2015 Korea Media Panel survey and discovered that enhanced digital skills led to stronger NFC. This causal effect was stronger for the older cohort (baby boomers and older, who were born before 1963). These findings suggest that older adults' NFC may not necessarily decline with age if they practice more digital skills. This study could ultimately contribute to the transformation of the older population from a digital minority to a digital beneficiary.},

Corrugator electromyography, behaviour and self-reports of affect were measured as indices of emotion regulation. Results indicate that working memory updating predicted negative affect reduction during reappraisal and during expressive suppression. This study specifically shows that the working memory component of cognitive control is associated with negative affect reduction. Response inhibition and set-shifting were not specifically related to negative affect reduction, but these variables did predict aspects of emotional behaviour and regulation. These results suggest a general role for cognitive control in some aspects of emotion regulation as well as a specific modulatory role for working memory updating in the regulation of negative affect.},

Current neuroimaging studies regarding emotion regulation have implicated a number of cortical regions and identified several EEG features of interest, including the late positive potential and frontal asymmetry. Unfortunately, currently applied methods generally lack in the resolution necessary to capture focal cortical activity and explore the causal interactions between brain regions. In this paper, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were simultaneously recorded from 20 subjects undergoing emotion processing and regulation tasks. Cortical activity with high-spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy was reconstructed using a novel multimodal EEG/fMRI integration method. A detailed causal brain network associated with emotion processing and regulation was then identified, and the network changes that facilitate different emotion conditions were investigated. The cortical activity of the ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPFC) and posterior parietal cortices depicted conditionally-sensitive spike and wave patterns evidenced in inter-regional communication. The VLPFC was found to behave as a main network source, with conditionally-specific interactions supporting emotional shifts. The results provide unique insight into the cortical activity that supports emotional perception and regulation, the origins of known EEG phenomena, and the manner in which brain regions coordinate to affect behavior.},

Research indicates that some hesitant parents? mistrust extends to specific conspiracy ideation, but research on vaccine conspiracy beliefs is still scarce. Our objective was to explore factors contributing to parental vaccine conspiracy beliefs and actual vaccine uptake in children. Design: A cross-sectional correlational design with a non-probabilistic sample of 823 volunteer participants surveyed online. Main outcome measures: We focussed on the contributions of the analytically rational and experientially intuitive thinking styles, as well as measures of emotional functioning, namely optimism and emotions towards vaccination, to vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccine uptake as outcomes. Results: The obtained results showed that greater vaccine conspiracy beliefs were associated with stronger unpleasant emotions towards vaccination and greater experientially intuitive thinking, as well as lower levels of education. Furthermore, unpleasant emotions towards vaccination and intuitive thinking were associated with vaccine refusal. Conclusion: These findings confirm the primary importance of emotions, along with the propensity towards intuitive thinking, in the context of vaccine conspiracy beliefs and refusal, supporting the notion that parents? avoidance is guided by their affect. These results have direct implications for addressing vaccine hesitancy within public campaigns and policies.},

  abstract   = {Research has shown that athletes' attitudes towards the use of banned performance-enhancing substances are reliable predictors of their intentions to use these substances, which in turn can be relevant predictors of their actual doping behaviours. Despite the important role played by attitudes and intentions in doping, research analysing how to change those attitudes and intentions is relatively scarce. The present study examined how individual differences in Need for Cognition (NC, Cacioppo \& Petty, 1982) influenced doping-related attitude change and subsequent behavioural intentions. Participants were randomly assigned to read a persuasive message either against or in favour of legalising the use of several banned substances, including anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) and Erythropoietin (EPO). In addition, participants completed the NC scale, and finally reported their attitudes and behavioural intentions regarding the legalisation proposal. As hypothesised, results showed that participants who received an anti-legalisation message had significantly more unfavourable attitudes towards the proposal than participants who received a pro-legalisation message, regardless of NC. However, as predicted, NC moderated the relationship between individuals' attitudes and their intentions. That is, high-NC participants showed greater attitude-intention correspondence than low-NC participants.},

Methods: We randomized 402 participants to one of 4 different risk message sets that were manipulated in terms of emotionality and framing in a 2x2 design: (1) factual gain-framed, (2) factual loss-framed, (3) emotional gain-framed, and (4) emotional loss-framed. Results: Statistically significant main effects emerged for NFC and emotionality. For certain risk perceptions, those with lower NFC reported greater perceived risk in response to emotional messages and lower risk in response to factual messages; those with higher NFC showed an opposite pattern. Similarly, those with lower NFC reported greater risk in response to gain-framed messages and lower risk in response to loss-framed messages; the opposite pattern emerged for those lower in NFC. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of an individual difference variable in influencing the impact of different types of smoking risk messages.},

  abstract = {Advances in graph-theoretic models of networks have made it possible to investigate the topological properties of the human brain across time and space. Brain flexibility is defined as the frequency with which brain regions switch between different functional modules over time and has been shown to correlate with higher-order cognitive functions. Need for cognition (NFC) refers to a personality trait to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors and usually has a positive effect on diverse cognitive activities (e.g., creativity), which may also be closely related to brain flexibility. Here, we tested whether the flexibility of a large-scale brain network associated with NFC facilitated creative achievement. Robust correlation analyses showed that NFC correlates with the flexibility of the insula, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the putamen at the node level. Several large-scale brain networks whose flexibility also correlated with NFC, including the default mode network, salience network, subcortical network, ventral attention network, and control network, imply that higher NFC individuals may exhibit better cognitive abilities, such as executive control, salient detection, spontaneous thought, and motivation function. Interestingly, only global flexibility acted as a mediator in the relationship between NFC and creative achievement, suggesting that the mediating mechanism may involve an interaction between distinct regions or large-scale networks across the entire brain instead of the functional characteristic of local regions. Together, we demonstrate that the higher NFC is, the more flexible the brain, which may provide a potential insight into the acquisition of creative achievement.},

The results show that the users exposed themselves to balanced and diverse online information about vaccination. However, none of the examined cognitive factors (attitude toward vaccination, attitude salience, prior knowledge about vaccination, need for cognition, and cognitive involvement) influenced the amount of time users spent searching the Internet for information about vaccination. Our study was not able to document any effects of attitude-consistent selective exposure to online information about vaccination. In addition, we found no effect on attitude change after having searched the Internet for vaccine-related information. Thus, users' search behavior regarding vaccination seems to be relatively stable.},

Individual differences included preexisting accurate and inaccurate beliefs on the topic, prior knowledge about how vaccinations work, need for cognition, and flexible thinking. Dependent measures included an essay assessing vaccination support and a readministration of the preexisting topic beliefs inventory immediately after reading and after a 2-day delay. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated belief consistency effects in that preexisting accurate and inaccurate beliefs stably predict their postreading counterparts. Above and beyond these effects, readers higher in need for cognition were more likely to gain accurate beliefs about childhood vaccination at immediate and delayed time points. However, a backfire effect was also observed such that readers higher in flexible thinking were more likely to gain inaccurate beliefs, with concomitant lower values on accurate beliefs; this effect was present immediately and at a delay. The findings confirm that people can display a strong myside bias even when reading refutations, but that higher need for cognition affords opportunities for appropriate knowledge revision. At the same time, our findings suggest an alarming, potentially detrimental aspect of refutational texts: They may introduce opportunities for some learners to acquire novel misconceptions, especially if they are more flexible thinkers. Future directions of the current work are discussed.},

However, there is a distinct lack of empirical research examining the role of dispositional factors in these differences and understanding these associations could provide valuable insight into decision-making. Here, we examine whether individual differences in cognitive reflection are related to narcissism (excessive self-focused attention) and impulsiveness (trait-based lack of inhibitory control). Participants across three studies completed measures of narcissism, impulsiveness and cognitive reflection. Results indicate that grandiose and vulnerable narcissists differ in their performance on problem-solving tasks (i.e., Cognitive Reflection Test [CRT]) and preferences for intuitive thinking, as well as the degree to which they reflect on and understand their own thoughts and enjoy cognitively effortful activities. Additionally, though impulsiveness was significantly related to self-report measures of cognitive reflection (i.e., metacognitive reflection, metacognitive insight, and need for cognition), it showed no association with a behavioural measure of cognitive reflection (i.e., CRT scores). Our results suggest that certain individual differences in dispositional and personality characteristics may play important roles in the extent to which individuals engage in certain forms of reflective thinking.},

Although the tenets of dual process theory would argue that effortful thinking should attenuate people's reliance on heuristics, a number of contemporary findings suggest otherwise: Effortful thinking may, in fact, enhance biased processing of information in certain instances. This research shows how, in the context of pricing, people's degrees of effortful thinking can amplify their inclination towards biased processing of price information. In five studies (n = 1,339), we find that effortful thinking induces a greater preference for nine-ending (vs. zero-ending) prices, and the effect is mainly driven by people's greater propensity for argument-based decision making. Such predilection to nine-endings attenuates with lower cognitive effort in processing price information. Moreover, when locus of deliberation shifts from price to quality, consumers' preference for nine-ending priced options is subdued.},

Here, we examined self-regulation of stimulus-elicited insula activation and performed a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis of real-time self-regulation data. During voluntary up-regulation of the left anterior insula in the presence of threat-related pictures, differential activations were observed in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the frontal operculum, the middle cingulate cortex and the right insula. Down-regulation in comparison to no-regulation revealed additional activations in right superior temporal cortex, right inferior parietal cortex and right middle frontal cortex. There was a significant learning effect over sessions during up-regulation, documented by a significant improvement of anterior insula control over time. Connectivity analysis revealed that successful up-regulation of the activity in left anterior insula while viewing aversive pictures was directly modulated by dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Down-regulation of activity was more difficult to achieve and no learning effect was observed. More extensive training might be necessary for successful down-regulation. These findings illustrate the functional interactions between different brain areas during regulation of anterior insula activity in the presence of threat-related stimuli.},

  abstract = {The capacity to voluntarily regulate emotions is critical for mental health, especially when coping with aversive events. Several neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation found the amygdala to be a target for downregulation and prefrontal regions to be associated with downregulation. To characterize the role of prefrontal regions in bidirectional emotion regulation and to investigate regulatory influences on amygdala activity and peripheral physiological measures, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with simultaneous recording of self-report, startle eyeblink, and skin conductance responses was carried out. Subjects viewed threat-related pictures and were asked to up- and downregulate their emotional responses using reappraisal strategies. While startle eyeblink responses (in successful regulators) and skin conductance responses were amplified during upregulation, but showed no consistent effect during downregulation, amygdala activity was increased and decreased according to the regulation instructions. Trial-by-trial ratings of regulation success correlated positively with activity in amygdala during upregulation and orbitofrontal cortex during downregulation. Downregulation was characterized by left-hemispheric activation peaks in anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex and upregulation was characterized by a pattern of prefrontal activation not restricted to the left hemisphere. Further analyses showed significant overlap of prefrontal activation across both regulation conditions, possibly reflecting cognitive processes underlying both up-arid downregulation, but also showed distinct activations in each condition. The present study demonstrates that amygdala responses to threat-related stimuli can be controlled through the use of cognitive strategies depending on recruitment of prefrontal areas, thereby changing the subject's affective state.},

Viewing highly arousing images led to a significant enhancement of EEG coherence between prefrontal and posterior electrodes in both cerebral hemispheres. Long distance interhemispheric coherence also increased during affective image viewing, but only among females. Increases in coherent brain electrical activity were specific to oscillations in the beta (14 to 30Hz) bandwidth, while right hemispheric networks oscillating in the theta (4 to 7Hz) range tended to de-synchronize during viewing of affective images. Although directionality could not be inferred, analyses of lead–lag relations showed the prefrontal electrodes leading the posterior clusters, consistent with top–down modulation. Our results suggest large-scale synchronization of cortical cells during affective viewing and emphasize the role of beta oscillations in mediating such binding.},

Two independent samples were exposed to an emotional stimulation paradigm in which the participants were invited to get involved and sympathize with the persons they were watching (study 1) or listening to (study 2), and who were expressing sadness or anxiety. The two studies yielded consistent results. Higher scores in trait absorption and in the propensity to ruminate were associated with decreased EEG beta coherence during the stimulation, whereas coherence increased in individuals low in absorption or rumination. Coherence changes did not predict to which degree the participants felt infected by the displayed emotions, but in individuals showing decreased prefrontal–posterior coupling during the stimulation, feelings of sadness and anxiety had a greater tendency to persist. The findings suggest that more loose prefrontal–posterior coupling may be related to loosening of control of the prefrontal cortex over incoming social–emotional information and, consequently, to deeper emotional involvement and absorption, whereas increased prefrontal–posterior coupling may be related to strong control, dampening of emotional experience, and not letting oneself become emotionally affected.},

We studied emotion transitions, which correspond to dynamic conditions of varying affective valence or intensities. Functional coupling of prefrontal and posterior cortex (EEG coherence) was recorded during exposure to stable versus changing emotion-eliciting images (static vs. dynamic conditions). Prefrontal-posterior coupling was decreased in the dynamic conditions compared to the static conditions. A decrease in prefrontal-posterior coupling implies less control of the prefrontal cortex over perceptual information, which may allow the brain to become more affected by emotional fluctuations. We also assessed the aftereffect of EEG coherence on executive functioning, utilizing the flanker task. Among individuals reporting higher chronic stress, executive functioning decreased after dynamic conditions. This decrease in executive functioning was mediated by the decrease in prefrontal-posterior coupling in the dynamic conditions. These findings suggest that the strength of prefrontal-posterior coupling is not only related to emotional transitions but also to executive functioning. The deterioration of executive functioning after dynamic emotional processing may reflect the additional cognitive effort required to process dynamic shifts in affective stimuli, and this relationship is exacerbated by chronic stress.},

  abstract = {Background and aims: Unregulated Internet pornography (IP) use is discussed as a clinically significant disorder. Because of its primarily rewarding nature, IP is a predestinated target for addictive behaviors. However, not every user develops an unregulated usage pattern. In fact, most users tend to use IP recreationally. Impulsivity-related constructs have been identified as promoters of addictive behaviors. It is unclear whether these impulsivity-related constructs are specific for unregulated IP use or also play a role in recreational but frequent behaviors. In this study, we investigated impulsive tendencies (trait impulsivity, delay discounting, and cognitive style), craving toward IP, attitude regarding IP, and coping styles in individuals with recreational-occasional, recreational-frequent, and unregulated IP use. Methods: A total of 1,498 heterosexual males participated in an online survey. Groups of individuals with recreational-occasional use (n = 333), recreational-frequent use (n = 394), and unregulated use (n = 225) of IP were identified by screening instruments. Results: Craving and attitude regarding IP as well as delay discounting and cognitive and coping styles differed between groups. Individuals with unregulated use showed the highest scores for craving, attentional impulsivity, delay discounting, and dysfunctional coping, and lowest scores for functional coping and need for cognition. Recreational-frequent users had the most positive attitude toward IP. Motor and non-planning impulsivity did not differ between groups. Discussion and conclusions: The results indicate that some facets of impulsivity and related factors such as craving and a more negative attitude are specific for unregulated IP users. The results are also consistent with models on specific Internet use disorders and addictive behaviors.},

  abstract   = {The ability to regulate emotions is related to psychological, social, and physical health. The two major emotion regulation strategies are cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES). Research suggests that CR produces affective, cognitive, and social consequences that are more beneficial to the individual, whereas ES has been consistently linked to more detrimental consequences. Although an increasing number of studies have begun to focus on the neural mechanisms of different types of emotion regulation, there has not yet been systematic research on the spontaneous brain activity associated with CR and ES. Resting activity has been shown to predict performance outcomes, highlight the functional relevance of the brain's intrinsic fluctuations in response outputs. However, to date, there have been no studies to explore the relationship between the cognitive process of emotion regulation and the brain's resting EEG activity. The current study explored the neural mechanisms of spontaneous brain activity during two emotion regulation strategies. Electroencephalography (EEG) enables direct measurement of neuronal activity, allowing characterization of the intrinsic neural cognitive network. Thirty-six college students (17 males and 19 females, aged 17 similar to 28 years old) participated in this study. For the first part of the study, EEG data was collected from participants with closed eyes; EEG collection occurred for a duration of 6 minutes. Neurological studies of resting state EEG have identified the predominant role of theta waves in determining cognitive control effort and behavioral performance. In the current study, source localization and graph theory analysis revealed that node efficiency was significantly correlated with the two major emotion regulation strategies, and there were functional connections between brain regions in the theta band. Then, in order to improve the reliability of the resting result obtained above, a within subjects experiment was carried out. This experiment required subjects to watch emotional pictures under four emotion regulation conditions (watching neutral, watching negative, reappraisal negative, suppressing negative). The Late-positive potential (LPP) amplitude was obtained when viewing the emotional pictures under the four conditions. LPP is an effective physiological indicator of the emotion regulation effect. It allowed us to explore the emotion regulation effect under different emotion regulation strategies, and the intrinsic functional connections and node efficiency of the brain. The results showed that the habitual use of CR was significantly correlated with several brain regions. Specifically, the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortex. Moreover, the brain regions significantly correlated with the LPP amplitude under CR were the parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and occipital cortex. The brain regions that were significantly correlated with habitual use of ES included the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, insula, and parahippocampal gyrus. Finally, the brain regions that were significantly associated with LPP amplitude under ES included the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal cortex, and occipital cortex. Thus, these findings reveal that many brain regions are involved in these two mood regulation strategies, including the prefrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex. In addition, the brain regions related to the different emotion regulation strategies differed slightly; specifically, CR was significantly associated with the anterior cingulate cortex while ES was related to temporal lobe and insula activation. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that use of CR for emotion regulation is associated with activation of multiple brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and occipital cortex. On the other hand, the use of ES for emotional regulation was associated with activation of various brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, occipital cortex, temporal cortex and insula. Node efficiency or functional connectivity of these brain regions appears to be a suitable indicator for assessing the effects of the ES and CR emotion regulation strategies.},

Prior studies of college students' sleep deprivation have focused on academic outcomes and mental health problems. This study considers the impact of college students' sleep deprivation on two key, developmental outcomes: leadership and need for cognition. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of longitudinal data from the Wabash National Study of Liberal Arts Education (N = 3,690), using random-effects and fixed-effects models to estimate the association between chronic sleep deprivation from freshman year to senior year and developmental outcomes. Results: Results from the random-effects model show that chronic sleep deprivation is negatively associated with lower scores in leadership skills (beta = -.09 P {\textless} . 001) and need for cognition (beta = -.08 P {\textless} . 001), after accounting for potential confounders. Results from the fixed-effects model that accounts for time-invariant unobserved variables show similar patterns for leadership skills (beta = -.09 P {\textless} . 01) and need for cognition (beta = -.06 P {\textless} . 01). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that chronic sleep deprivation has consequences for critical skills, suggesting that steps to promote college students' sleep health may also enhance their positive development in leadership skills and need for cognition.},

Across these four experiments, we varied perpetrator-victim relationships (teacher-student, neighbors) and victims' ages. In experiment one, individuals had the least negative attitude about child sexual abuse involving adult female neighbors and eighth grade male neighbors. In experiment two, we replicated this effect with fifth grade victims and demonstrated that attitudes were moderated by individual differences in intolerance of ambiguity. In experiment three, we again replicated the aforementioned effect while (a) extending this finding to teacher-student relationships with eighth grade adolescent victims and (b) demonstrating the need for cognition was a moderator. In experiment four, we again replicated (a) our perpetrator sex/victim sex interactive effect and (b) need for cognition moderation while also demonstrating that these effects were applicable to fifth grade victims. Methodological limitations as well as clinical and policy implications (e.g., attenuating the underreporting incidents of child sexual abuse) are discussed.},

Results revealed that perceived busyness peaked in 30-year-olds, showed age-related decreases until age 60, and then remained stable. Moreover, women generally reported being busier than men. Analysis of age by gender interactions revealed that men exhibited a significant cubic age effect for busyness, whereas women did not. Overall, younger age, female gender, agreeableness, neuroticism, frequent participation in novel activities, and enjoyment of cognitive processing were independently associated with being busier, and the characteristics related to busyness were generally stable across age. Notably, participation in novel activities and need for cognition were the most predictive lifestyle characteristics, supporting the framing of busyness as an indicator of mental engagement. We also propose personality-based sources of self-generated and other-generated busyness.},

We investigated this question in a large population-wide sample of 4,134 individuals (Study 1) and in a sample of 125 students (Study 2). NFC was consistently negatively related to the burnout facets emotional exhaustion and reduced personal efficacy of the Maslach burnout inventory and explained up to 10\% additional variance in burnout symptoms over and above the five-factor model of personality. In the student sample, where stress factors are mainly cognitive in nature, NFC was the most relevant predictor. In this sample, we additionally investigated whether NFC might be a relevant moderator of the inconsistently found associations between burnout and impairments in cognitive functioning. The participants conducted three cognitive tasks (number-letter task, two-back task, and Go/NoGo task) that measure the executive functions switching, updating, and response inhibition, respectively. While burnout was slightly negatively related to working memory performance, NFC did not moderate the relationship between burnout and executive control which could be traced back to the young and healthy sample used to examine this research question. All in all, our results clearly suggest that NFC may be an important individual difference factor contributing to the resilience against burnout, especially if stress factors are cognitive in nature.},

  abstract = {Boredom is likely one of the most prevalent, yet least understood, emotions. It is easy to find examples of how boredom can engender other negative emotional states that often lead to somewhat negative-albeit unintended-outcomes (e.g., risky or delinquent behaviors). But does boredom invariably lead to negative consequences? Could being bored also have less obvious effects, such as increased creativity? We explore the consequences of being bored using three experimental studies that manipulate boredom and identify the benefits for creativity of being bored. In Study 1, we found that boredom helped boost individual productivity on an idea-generation task. In Study 2, we showed that the boredom manipulation only increased boredom and not other negative activating emotions (i.e., anger and frustration), thus highlighting boredom's unique effect on creativity. In Study 3, we found that boredom did not universally increase creativity for a product development task; instead, only those individuals with a high learning goal orientation (LGO), high need for cognition (NOC), high openness to experience, and high internal locus of control (LOC) showed a significant increase in creativity when feeling bored. These counterintuitive findings offer an empirical basis and theoretical motivation for viewing boredom as a variety-driving emotion that motivates individuals to engage in novelty-seeking responses-i.e., engaging in different, often unusual, ways of doing things that are unlike typical or predictable responses. Building on our findings, we discuss how organizations can use this untapped resource to motivate employees for positive outcomes.},

Aims: Using a recommended suicide measurement approach for epidemiological studies (i.e. the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R)), the present investigation assessed United Kingdom young adult suicide prevalence rates. This study also investigated the utility of a Preferences in Information Processing (PIP) model of suicide in identifying those at increased odds for elevated suicide risk, as well as lifetime ideation and attempt. Method: A cross-sectional mental health and well-being survey study (n = 414) was conducted. Results: The prevalence rates of elevated risk (49.8\%), lifetime ideation only (55.3\%) and lifetime attempt (13.5\%) were high. Bivariate associations demonstrated that elevated depression, anxiety and Need for Affect (NFA) Avoidance were associated with worsened suicide outcomes, whereas elevated Need for Cognition (NFC) was associated with decreased suicide risk. Logistic regression results identified depression and NFA Avoidance as the strongest predictors of elevated suicide risk. Multinomial logistic regression results established several PIP-based moderation effects for depression and anxiety in which NFA Approach and NFC differentially influenced odds of suicide attempt group membership. Conclusion: The SBQ-R is an appropriate tool for UK young adult suicide research. NFA and NFC demonstrated potential for inclusion in young adult suicide prevention programming. Further research is needed to fully evaluate the PIP model of suicide and effectiveness of proposed theory-based approaches to suicide prevention.},

Based on first research regarding users' motives for using activity trackers and self-determination theory, we examined usage motives as predictors for the current and estimated future usage intensity. In addition, we investigated the relation of usage motives and user diversity facets (affinity for technology interaction, geekism, and need for cognition). Results of an online study with N = 58 regular users of activity trackers indicated a substantial variation of users' intrinsic/extrinsic motivation for using an activity tracker. Further, positive relationships between intrinsic motivation, autonomous regulation and usage intensity were found. Regarding user diversity, affinity for technology interaction and geekism predicted the intrinsic motivation whereas need for cognition did not. Our results imply that, in order to obtain possible beneficial health effects of a more intensive activity tracker usage, users' intrinsic motivation and autonomy have to be supported.},

  abstract = {Schizotypy refers to the continuum of normal variability of psychosis-like characteristics and experiences, often classified as positive schizotypy ('unusual experiences'; UE) and negative schizotypy ('introvertive anhedonia'; IA). Here, we investigated the link between schizotypy and cognitive processing style and performance. A particular focus was on whether schizotypy is associated more with Type 1 (automatic/heuristic) than Type 2 (reflective/effortful) processes, as may be expected from findings of impaired top-down control in schizophrenia. A large sample (n = 1,512) completed online measures pertaining to schizotypy (Oxford-Liverpool Inventory for Feelings and Experiences; O-LIFE), thinking style (Rational Experiential Inventory-10, Actively Open-Minded Thinking Scale), and reasoning performance (Cognitive Reflection Test). Higher positive (UE) and negative (IA) schizotypy were associated with more pronounced Type 1 processing, i.e. greater self-reported Faith in Intuition (FI), lower Need for Cognition (NFC), lower Actively Open-Minded Thinking (AOT), and lower cognitive reflection test (CRT) scores. Canonical correlation analysis confirmed a significant association between UE and increased FI, lower AOT and lower CRT performance, accounting for 12.38\% of the shared variance between schizotypy and thinking dispositions. IA was more highly associated with reduced NFC. These findings suggest that schizotypy may be associated with similar thinking dispositions to those reported in psychosis, with different patterns of associations for positive and negative schizotypy. This result informs research on reasoning processes in psychosis and has clinical implications, including potential treatment targets and refinements for cognitive therapies.},

  abstract   = {Personal initiative training is a promising way to increase entrepreneurial personal initiative, which is a key behavior for successful entrepreneurship. Although personal initiative training has been shown to promote personal initiative, little is known about how this proactive behavior can be maintained over time and what the consequences are. The training transfer literature suggests that training effects usually decline with time. It is not clear, however, which factors contribute to personal initiative maintenance and which benefits go along with it. In a randomized controlled field experiment with 912 microentrepreneurs in Lome, Togo, we investigate the influence of need for cognition-a cognitive factor driving proactive behavior-on personal initiative maintenance after training. In addition, we examine the effect of need for cognition on the well-being consequences of personal initiative maintenance. We show that people high in need for cognition tend to maintain posttraining personal initiative longer than those low in need for cognition. However, contrary to our predictions, need for cognition has no effect on the level of well-being that results from personal initiative maintenance. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of personal initiative and its maintenance and could be used to increase training effectiveness.},

On SNS, news posts lack the traditional news cues that guide audience selection of stories. Instead, they are accompanied by social cues, traces of engagement by other users with news items. This process is known as the socialization of news. This study sought to test the effect of the socialization of news on users' attention and selection processes. By means of an experimental design employing eye-tracking measurements (N = 86), the study (1) asked whether the existence of various social cues of endorsement (user comments, 'Likes', and 'Reactions') influenced attention and selection; (2) explored how users divided their attention between news information and social cues, and whether social endorsement affected the attention given by users to news cues; (3) identified differences among users regarding their sensitivity to social endorsement (relying on two psychological traits: self-monitoring and need for cognition). The findings demonstrate that social cues have some effect on attention and selection processes; however, users varied significantly in their response to social endorsement, both in terms of attention and selection. Together, the findings suggest that the socialization of news has changed news consumption processes, and that the consumption of news on SNS might require the development of a new theoretical approach to the consumption of news.},

It is the only book on the topic that covers both the theoretical background and the implementation in language that can be understood by readers without extensive formal training in mathematics, including cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and psychologists.Readers who go through the book chapter by chapter and implement the examples in Matlab will develop an understanding of why and how analyses are performed, how to interpret results, what the methodological issues are, and how to perform single-subject-level and group-level analyses. Researchers who are familiar with using automated programs to perform advanced analyses will learn what happens when they click the “analyze now” button.The book provides sample data and downloadable Matlab code. Each of the 38 chapters covers one analysis topic, and these topics progress from simple to advanced. Most chapters conclude with exercises that further develop the material covered in the chapter. Many of the methods presented (including convolution, the Fourier transform, and Euler's formula) are fundamental and form the groundwork for other advanced data analysis methods.

The findings show that the viewer's residence was a significant moderator in the preference for the interactivity functions. Viewers from developed regions liked the four functions better than those in underdeveloped regions. Social media habits and ICT power usage are positively associated with the preference, while need for cognition, age and gender had little effect. The findings can help understand the evolving viewing habits in the social media era, whose theoretical and practical implications should benefit TV makers and content producers to provide an interactive TV viewing experience.},

However, we have limited knowledge of the psychological antecedents of food personality. In this short communication, using survey data from 1006 Turkish consumers, we conduct an exploratory study of the distal and proximal predictors (i.e. psychological traits and other individual differences stemming from traits) of one dimension of food personality, namely food neophilia. Our findings suggest that promotion focus and materialism are proximal predictors of food neophilia, and openness to experience, extraversion, need for cognition and need for touch are distal predictors that have indirect effects on food neophilia through promotion focus and materialism.},

This study experimentally investigated this question by assessing what cognitive traits moderated responses to literary and less-literary fictional vignettes. Specifically, participants were exposed to two variants of a celebrated literary text, one altered so as to remove overtly literary elements. A moderation analysis was performed on responses with respect to three variables: need for cognition (NC); meaning in life (measured in two subscales, search for meaning [SM] and presence of meaning [PM]); and intentionality/mentalizing ability (IM). Results showed that SM moderated interpretive response to the textual variation, such that those with increasing scores on the SM scale were increasingly more likely to rate the literary vignettes as worthy of appreciation. This result, in turn, gave grounds for a second study that investigated the role played by cloze values in identifying a text as "literary." The latter study showed that the literary and less-literary vignettes exhibited significant differences in cloze values. Taken together, these studies suggest that differences in responsiveness to literary materials may well be driven by preexisting cognitive factors.},

This study tests theoretical assumptions related to these claims. Sixty-five Irish university students took part in an active-controlled mixed factorial experiment designed to investigate the effects of a guided mindfulness meditation on the primary measures of executive function and critical thinking. The secondary measures assessed key thinking dispositions, including the need for cognition and actively open-minded thinking, state mindfulness and dispositional mindfulness. The 2 x 2 mixed analyses of variance showed no evidence of an effect of the interaction between time (pre vs. post) and group (mindfulness vs. sham meditation) on executive function indices (p {\textless} 0.39) or critical thinking performance (p = 0.11). No evidence was found for indirect effects of group allocation on critical thinking through either state mindfulness or executive function. Moderation models demonstrated evidence that the effects of the mindfulness meditation on critical thinking were conditional on need for cognition (b = -0.24 [-0.40, -0.08]) and actively open-minded thinking (b = -0.14 [-0.25, -0.04]) dispositions. In addition, participants who reported low levels of non-reactivity demonstrated decreased critical thinking performance following the mindfulness meditation, which was mediated by slower reaction times on the executive functioning task (b = -53.37 [-92.65, -14.08]). In summary, a brief guided mindfulness meditation appears to facilitate critical thinking for those low in need for cognition and actively open-minded thinking. However, it is unclear whether executive function is a mechanism underlying this relationship.},

Multivariable analyses showed that health literacy, information avoidance and believing the disease is unpredictable - but not risk factor knowledge and need for cognition - best predicted participants' conversion from a DK response to a non-DK scale point response.Conclusion:Results confirm that both inadequate health literacy and higher information avoidance are associated with DK responding. DK responders are also disproportionately underserved and less adherent to health behaviors.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Increasingly, teenagers and young adults (TYAs) seek out health information online; however, it is not clear whether they possess electronic health (eHealth) literacy, defined as "the ability to select, appraise, and utilize good quality health information from the internet." A number of factors are included in the Lily model proposed by Norman and Skinner underpinning the development of eHealth literacy. It is important to understand which elements may influence the development of eHealth literacy in young people, as the current generation will continue to "Google it" when faced with a health problem throughout their lives.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to explore potential factors influencing young people's eHealth literacy and explore the underlying constructs of the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) in a population of UK university students.
METHODS: A total of 188 undergraduate psychology students from a large UK University were recruited as an opportunity sample. Of these, 88.8\% (167/188) of participants were female with a mean age of 20.13 (SD 2.16) years and the majority were White British (159/188, 84.6\%). Employing a cross-sectional design TYAs completed the following measures exploring eHealth literacy (eHEALS): Irrational Health Belief Scale; Newest Vital Sign (NVS), a measure of functional health literacy; Need for Cognition Scale, a preference for effortful cognitive activity; and General Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale, exploring personal agency and confidence. The eHEALS was also subject to exploratory factor analysis (EFA), for which in addition to the total variance explained, the scree plot, eigenvalues, and factor loadings were assessed to verify the structure.
RESULTS: eHEALS and GSE were significantly positively correlated (r=0.28, P{\textless}.001) and hierarchical linear modeling revealed GSE as the significant predictor of scores on the eHEALS (F1,186=16.16, P{\textless}.001, R2=0.08), accounting for 8.0\% of the variance. Other notable relationships were GSE and need for cognition (NFC) were also positively correlated (r=0.33, P{\textless}.001), and NFC and irrational health beliefs were significantly negatively correlated (r=-.14, P=.03). Using Spearman correlations, GSE and NVS (rs=0.14, P=.04) and NFC and NVS (rs=0.19, P=.003) were positively correlated. An EFA revealed the scale to be stable and identified a 2-factor structure related to information acquisition and information application.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in the UK to explore relationships between these key variables and verify the structure of the eHEALS in a TYA population in the UK. The findings that self-efficacy has a major influence firmly consolidate its status as fundamental to the development of eHealth literacy. Future studies will explore the influence of body image and the development of eHealth literacy in more diverse TYA populations.},

Additionally, the moderating role of an individual characteristic (need for cognition), and the mediating role of two processing outcomes (message elaboration and perceived message effectiveness) were examined. Results indicated that there was no significant difference between the main effects of metaphor modality and type of fear appeal, but these message features interacted making the death-based fear appeal the most effective strategy. Need for cognition directly affected perceptions of effectiveness but did not affect skin protection intentions nor message elaboration. Of the two message processing outcomes examined, only perceived message effectiveness mediated the relationship between metaphor modality and skin protection intentions. Theoretical explanations and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {In the United States, while the number of coronavirus case has kept increasing, the practice of social distancing and mask-wearing have been controversial and even politicized. The present study aimed to examine the role of psychological traits and political orientation in social distancing compliance and attitude toward mask-wearing. A sample of 233 U.S. adult residents were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants completed scales of social distancing compliance, attitude toward mask-wearing, need for cognition, self-control, risk preference, and political orientation. For each participant, epidemiological information (seven-day positive rate and the number of cases per 100,000) was obtained based on the state she/he resided in. As a result, there was no significant relationship between the epidemiological information and social distancing compliance or attitude toward mask-wearing. Instead, those who had a higher level of need for cognition, self-control, or risk averse were more positive on social distancing compliance and mask-wearing. Additionally, the study found political orientation was a significant factor, with a more liberal tendency being associated with more positive on social distancing compliance and mask-wearing. For mask-wearing, an interaction was also found between need for cognition and political orientation such that the effect of need for cognition was stronger in the more liberal participants than in the more conservative participants. Collectively, the study revealed the psychological and political roots of social distancing and mask-wearing compliance. Policy implications are discussed.},

A general reduction in consumption levels is considered necessary to attain global sustainability goals. However, knowledge regarding the factors driving people to deliberately consume less and how anti-consumption affects individuals' well-being is limited. Against this background, this study considers the influence of human values and the well-being effects of two types of anti-consumption: voluntary simplicity and collaborative consumption. Based on representative data from the US (N = 1075) and Germany (N = 1070), the findings show that the two anti-consumption types do not reduce the well-being of individuals' but in some cases, even improve it, which suggests that lowering consumption can not only help protect environmental resources but also serve the greater good of society. In particular, this relationship holds among collaborative consumers with a strong need for cognition, i.e., a cognitive thinking style that involves a high level of decision control. According to the study results, opposite value orientations are the drivers of voluntary simplicity and collaborative consumption (i.e., a focus on self-transcendence versus self-enhancement). These findings are comparable in both countries; however, the strength of the effects differs.},

The aim of this paper is to review existing literature for both the risks and benefits of red meat consumption, focusing on case–control and prospective studies. Despite many studies reporting an association between red meat and the risk of CVD and colon cancer, several methodological limitations and inconsistencies were identified which may impact on the validity of their findings. Overall, there is no strong evidence to support the recent conclusion from the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) report that red meat has a convincing role to play in colon cancer. A substantial amount of evidence supports the role of lean red meat as a positive moderator of lipid profiles with recent studies identifying it as a dietary source of the anti-inflammatory long chain (LC) n−3 PUFAs and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). In conclusion, moderate consumption of lean red meat as part of a balanced diet is unlikely to increase risk for CVD or colon cancer, but may positively influence nutrient intakes and fatty acid profiles, thereby impacting positively on long-term health.},

  abstract = {Many philosophers of science and methodologists have argued that the ability to repeat studies and obtain similar results is an essential component of science. A finding is elevated from single observation to scientific evidence when the procedures that were used to obtain it can be reproduced and the finding itself can be replicated. Recent replication attempts show that some high profile results – most notably in psychology, but in many other disciplines as well – cannot be replicated consistently. These replication attempts have generated a considerable amount of controversy, and the issue of whether direct replications have value has, in particular, proven to be contentious. However, much of this discussion has occurred in published commentaries and social media outlets, resulting in a fragmented discourse. To address the need for an integrative summary, we review various types of replication studies and then discuss the most commonly voiced concerns about direct replication. We provide detailed responses to these concerns and consider different statistical ways to evaluate replications. We conclude there are no theoretical or statistical obstacles to making direct replication a routine aspect of psychological science.},

Here, participants performed single target search, but the target was preceded by a to-be-ignored distractor varying in valence and arousal. When the critical distractor was a sexual word, lower target accuracy was observed, particularly at short distractor-target stimulus onset asynchronies, even when participants were shown the critical distractors beforehand and told to ignore them. No reduction in target accuracy was evidenced when the critical distractor was negative, positive, threatening, or emotionally neutral. Target accuracy was predicted by participants' arousal ratings to the critical distractor words and by their memory for them, but not by their valence ratings. Memory for critical distractors mediated the relationship between arousal and target accuracy. The results provide evidence that arousing sexual words involuntarily capture attention and enter awareness at the expense of goal-driven targets, at least in the context of laboratory experiments performed by young university participants for whom sexual material might have high impact and relevance.},

One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.
RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.
RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.
CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects.

A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired.

  abstract   = {Effect sizes are the currency of psychological research. They quantify the results of a study to answer the research question and are used to calculate statistical power. The interpretation of effect sizes—when is an effect small, medium, or large?—has been guided by the recommendations Jacob Cohen gave in his pioneering writings starting in 1962: Either compare an effect with the effects found in past research or use certain conventional benchmarks. The present analysis shows that neither of these recommendations is currently applicable. From past publications without pre-registration, 900 effects were randomly drawn and compared with 93 effects from publications with pre-registration, revealing a large difference: Effects from the former (median r = .36) were much larger than effects from the latter (median r = .16). That is, certain biases, such as publication bias or questionable research practices, have caused a dramatic inflation in published effects, making it difficult to compare an actual effect with the real population effects (as these are unknown). In addition, there were very large differences in the mean effects between psychological sub-disciplines and between different study designs, making it impossible to apply any global benchmarks. Many more pre-registered studies are needed in the future to derive a reliable picture of real population effects.},

Neural processes involved in these spontaneous facial reactions remain largely unknown. Here we concurrently recorded EEG and facial EMG in 15 participants watching short movie clips displaying either happy or angry facial expressions. EMG activity was recorded for the zygomaticus major (ZM) that elevates the lips during a smile, and the corrugator supercillii (CS) that knits the eyebrows during a frown. We found increased EMG activity of CS in response to angry expressions, and enhanced EMG activity of ZM for happy expressions, replicating earlier EMG studies. More importantly, we found that the amplitude of an early visual evoked potential (right P1) was larger when ZM activity to happy faces was high, and when CS activity to angry faces was high, as compared to when muscle reactions were low. Conversely, the amplitude of right N170 component was smaller when the intensity of facial imitation was high. These combined EEG–EMG results suggest that early visual processing of face expression may determine the magnitude of subsequent facial imitation, with dissociable effects for P1 and N170. These findings are discussed against the classical dual-route model of face recognition.},

After verifying that the amplitude of the evoked response P300 increases as the probability of oddball target presentation decreases, we explored the corresponding effect of target frequency on the fMRI signal. We predicted and confirmed that some regions that showed activation changes following each oddball are affected by the rate of presentation of the oddballs, or the probability of an oddball target. We postulated that those regions that increased activation with decreasing probability might be responsible for the corresponding changes in the P300 amplitude. fMRI regions that correlated with the amplitude of the P300 wave were supramarginal gyri, thalamus, insula and right medial frontal gyrus, and are presumably sources of the P300 wave. Other regions, such as anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, were activated during the oddball paradigm but their fMRI signal changes were not correlated with the P300 amplitudes. This study thus shows how combining fMRI and ERP in a parametric design identifies task-relevant sources of activity and allows separation of regions that have different response properties.},

Using the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion as a guide, we review evidence for five fundamental processes that occur at different points along the elaboration continuum. When the extent of thinking is constrained to be low, emotions influence attitudes by relatively simple processes that lead them to change in a manner consistent with the valence of the emotion. When thinking is constrained to be high, emotions can serve as arguments in favour of a proposal if they are relevant to the merits of the advocacy or they can bias thinking if the emotion precedes the message. If thinking is high and emotions become salient after thinking, they can lead people to rely or not rely on the thoughts generated either because the emotion leads people to like or dislike their thoughts (affective validation) or feel more confident or doubtful in their thoughts (cognitive validation). When thinking is unconstrained, emotions influence the extent of thinking about the persuasive communication. Although prior theories have addressed one or more of these fundamental processes, no other approach has integrated them into one framework.},

  abstract   = {Need for Cognition describes relatively stable interindividual differences in cognitive motivation. Previous research has shown relations of Need for Cognition to Self-Control–a capacity that can be broadly defined as resistance to temptation–yet, the processes underlying this relation remain unclear. One explanation for the prediction of Self-Control by Need for Cognition can be an increased motivation to invest cognitive effort with higher levels of Need for Cognition. Another possible link could be that individual differences in the implementation of Self-Control intentions may play a moderating or mediating role for the predictive value of Need for Cognition. Such individual differences in the self-motivated initiation and maintenance of intentions are described by dispositional Action Orientation. Therefore, in the present study, Action Orientation was examined with regard to its possible role in explaining the relation of Need for Cognition to Self-Control. In a sample of 1209 young adults, Self-Control was assessed with two different self-report instruments and moderation and mediation models of the relationship between Need for Cognition, Action Orientation, and Self-Control were tested. While there was no evidence for a moderating role of Action Orientation in explaining the relation of Need for Cognition and Self-Control, Action Orientation was found to partly mediate this relation with a remaining direct effect of Need for Cognition on Self-Control. These results add to the conceptual understanding of Need for Cognition and demonstrate the relevance of trait variables to predict Self-Control.},

  abstract   = {Venting—an emotion-focused form of coping involving the discharge of negative feelings to others—is common in organizational settings. Venting may benefit the self via the release of negative emotion, or by acting as a catalyst for changes to problematic work situations. Nonetheless, venting might have unintended consequences via its influence on those who are the recipients of venting from others. In light of this idea, we provide a theoretical explanation for how leaders in particular are affected by venting receipt at work. Drawing from the transactional model of stress, we theorize that venting tends to be appraised as a threat, which triggers negative emotion that, in turn, potentiates deviant action tendencies (i.e., interpersonal mistreatment). Yet, our theory suggests that not all leaders necessarily experience venting in the same way. Specifically, leaders with higher need for cognition are less influenced by surface-level cues associated with others’ emotional expressions and find challenging interpersonal situations to be less aversive, thereby attenuating the deleterious effects of receipt of venting. In an experience sampling study of 112 managers across 10 consecutive workdays, we find support for our theoretical model. Altogether, our findings provide insight into the costs incurred when leaders lend an ear to those who vent, which can result in negative downstream consequences.},

So far, no specific scale on this has been found in the major databases, thus the aim of this exploratory study is to develop a Panic Buying Scale (PBS) during COVID-19 pandemic. 393 Brazilians took part in this study (251 women and 142 men), answering a sociodemographic questionnaire and instruments of these variables: (1)panic buying, (2)impulse buying, (3)temporal focus, (4)optimism, (5)risk perception, (6)need for cognition. Data collection was conducted through an online questionnaire which was shared through social media networks, from April 10th to May 4th, 2020. Factorial exploratory and confirmatory analysis indicated that PBS has a unidimensional solution and showed satisfactory reliability indexes. Results revealed that men buy more by panic than women. PBS also was positively correlated with impulse buying, past and future temporal focus, and risk perception; as well as negatively correlated with optimism and age. Findings suggest that PBS is psychometrically acceptable in the Brazilian context. This new instrument can be useful to understand the psychosocial phenomena associated with consumer behavior. Future investigations could provide more evidences of validity in other contexts., Psychology; Fear; Panic buying; Psychometric properties; Consumer behavior; COVID-19; Consumption; Validity; Reliability.},

  abstract = {Multichannel recordings are commonly presented as topographic maps series displaying the change of the potential distribution over time. When reviewing a sequence of potential maps it becomes obvious that there are epochs with only little activity (few field lines; small extrema values) while at other times the fields display high peaks and deep troughs with steep gradients. The measure of global field power (GFP) corresponds to the spatial standard deviation, and it quantifies the amount of activity at each time point in the field considering the data from all recording electrodes simultaneously resulting in a reference-independent descriptor of the potential field. Global field power is plotted as a function of time, and the occurrence times of GFP maxima are used to determine the latencies of evoked potential components. The topographical change occurring in subsequent potential field distributions may also be quantified by computing an index of global dissimilarity. Global field power and global dissimilarity show a complementary behavior over time: in general, high GFP is associated with similar fields while during periods between GFP peaks the topographic patterns of successive field distributions change rapidly accompanied by high dissimilarity values. The topographic changes, however, are best recognized by a segmentation procedure that considers field structure independent of GFP and global dissimilarity. The principles and practical applications of GFP computation, component latency determination and global dissimilarity of potential field distributions as well as a topographical time segmentation procedure will be illustrated with multichannel data evoked by visual stimuli.},

Moreover, the limitations of these algorithms are discussed and compared with the standard signal processing algorithms, followed by the future suggestions to develop a reliable and efficient QRS methodology.

Moreover, reflex modulation and conductance change varied with arousal, whereas facial patterns were content specific.

We review the physiological bases of RSA and show that RSA arises from multiple tonic and phasic processes of both central and peripheral origin. These underlying mechanisms are at least partially differentiated, have distinct dynamics and consequences, and may be differentially sensitive to behavioral and cognitive events. These multiple mechanisms are relevant for psychophysiological studies of RSA, and a thorough understanding of RSA can only be achieved through an appreciation of the dynamics of its underlying origins. There is a distinction between the psychophysiological and neurophysiological domains, and conceptual and empirical bridges between these domains are needed.},

In consideration of the disproportionate CVD risk and disease profile of African Americans (AAs), it is plausible that decreased cardiac parasympathetic functioning may partially explain these disparities. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we assess the available evidence for a reliable ethnic difference in tonic vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of parasympathetic cardiac modulation.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted yielding studies comparing tonic HRV in AAs and European Americans. Adjusted standardized effect sizes (Hedges g) were calculated using a mixed-effects model, with restricted maximum likelihood estimation for 17 studies containing appropriate measures of vagally mediated HRV.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis results suggest that AAs have greater HRV than do European Americans (Hedges g = 0.93, 95\% confidence interval = 0.25-1.62), even after consideration of several covariates including health status, medication use, and subgroup stratification by sex and age.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that decreased vagally mediated HRV is not likely to account for the persistent health disparities experienced by AAs with respect to CVD risk and burden. These disparities underscore the need for continued research addressing socioethnic cardiovascular differences and the biobehavioral mechanisms involved.},

Females showed a significantly lower mean RR interval and standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN). The power spectral density of HRV in females is characterized by significantly less total power that contains significantly greater high- (HF) and less low-frequency (LF) power. This is further reflected by a lower LF/HF ratio. Meta-regression revealed significant effects of age, respiration control and the length of recording available for analysis. Although women showed greater mean heart rate, they showed greater vagal activity indexed by HF power of HRV. Underlying mechanisms of these findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {Psychophysiological research integrating heart rate variability (HRV) has increased during the last two decades, particularly given the fact that HRV is able to index cardiac vagal tone. Vagal tone, which represents the activity of the parasympathetic system, is acknowledged to be linked with many phenomena relevant for psychophysiological research, including self-regulation at the cognitive, emotional, social, and health levels. The ease of HRV collection and measurement coupled with the fact it is relatively affordable, non-invasive and pain free makes it widely accessible to many researchers. This ease of access should not obscure the difficulty of interpretation of HRV findings that can be easily misconstrued, however this can be controlled to some extent through correct methodological processes. Standards of measurement were developed two decades ago by a Task Force within HRV research, and recent reviews updated several aspects of the Task Force paper. However, many methodological aspects related to HRV in psychophysiological research have to be considered if one aims to be able to draw sound conclusions, which makes it difficult to interpret findings and to compare results across laboratories. Those methodological issues have mainly been discussed in separate outlets, making difficult to get a grasp on them, and thus this paper aims to address this issue. It will help to provide psychophysiological researchers with recommendations and practical advice concerning experimental designs, data analysis, and data reporting. This will ensure that researchers starting a project with HRV and cardiac vagal tone are well informed regarding methodological considerations in order for their findings to contribute to knowledge advancement in their field.},

The current study used a thought suppression paradigm in which participants recorded occurrences of a personally relevant intrusive thought over three monitoring periods. Among those instructed to suppress, higher levels of HRV were associated with greater declines in intrusions across the monitoring periods; no such relationship was found among those assigned to a control condition. Resting HRV also interacted with spontaneous thought suppression effort to predict intrusive thought frequency. In both cases, these HRV‐related differences in thought suppression success predicted the generalized distress symptoms common to depression and anxiety. These findings enhance understanding of the relationships between HRV and cognitive control and highlight how individual differences in self‐regulatory capacity impact thought suppression success and emotion regulation.

However, existing findings of relations between self-regulation and HRV indices are mixed. To clarify the nature of such relations, we conducted a meta-analysis of 123 studies (N=14,347) reporting relations between HRV indices and aspects of top-down self-regulation (e.g., executive functioning, emotion regulation, effortful control). A significant, albeit small, effect was observed (r=0.09) such that greater HRV was related to better top-down self-regulation. Differences in relations were negligible across aspects of self-regulation, self-regulation measurement methods, HRV computational techniques, at-risk compared with healthy samples, and the context of HRV measurement. Stronger relations were observed in older relative to younger samples and in published compared to unpublished studies. These findings generally support the notion that HRV indices can tentatively be employed as bio-markers of top-down self-regulation. Conceptual and theoretical implications, and critical gaps in current knowledge to be addressed by future work, are discussed.},

The results of the study generally confirmed the prediction that individuals who are high in regulatory control were relatively unlikely to experience high levels of negative emotional arousal in response to stressors, but this relation held only for moderate- to high-intensity stressors. Moreover, under conditions of moderate to high stress, highly regulated individuals were likely to cope constructively with the stressor. Mediational analyses suggested that the relation of regulatory control to constructive coping was partially mediated by negative emotional arousal. The results support the conclusion that individual differences in regulatory control interact with situational factors in influencing the prediction of stress-related responses.

Facial expressions were videotaped during movie presentation and later rated in terms of valence. Regression analyses revealed that participants with higher baseline RSA levels expressed less negative (i.e., more neutral) facial affect to the negative film, but resting RSA did not predict facial valence to the positive film. In addition, RSA did not predict self-reported affect or sympathetic reactivity (EDRs), indicating that the pattern of facial responding exhibited by individuals with higher resting RSA was not the result of an active response modulation process (e.g., facial suppression or stimulus reappraisal). Although baseline RSA predicted RSA reactivity during the negative film, RSA reactivity did not predict facial valence. Results are discussed in terms of the relationship between cardiac vagal control, emotional expression, and self-regulation ability.},

  abstract   = {Difficulties in emotion regulation are associated with development and maintenance of psychopathology. Typically, features of emotion regulation are assessed with self-report questionnaires. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an objective measure proposed as an index of emotional regulation capacity. A limited number of studies have shown that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation are associated with HRV. However, results from prior studies are inconclusive, and an ecological validation of the association has not yet been tested. Therefore, further exploration of the relation between self-report questionnaires and psychophysiological measures of emotional regulation is needed. The present study investigated the contribution of self-reported emotion regulation difficulties on HRV in a student sample. We expected higher scores on emotion regulation difficulties to be associated with lower vagus-mediated HRV (vmHRV). Sixty-three participants filled out the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and their resting HRV was assessed. In addition, a subsample of participants provided ambulatory 24 hour HRV data, in order to ecologically validate the resting data. Correlation analyses indicated that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation was negatively associated with vmHRV in both resting HRV and 24 hour HRV. Specifically, when exploring the contribution of the different facets of emotion dysregulation, the inability to accept negative emotions showed the strongest association with HRV. The results are discussed and need for future research is described.},

Perceived ethnic discrimination (PED), defined as the degree to which an individual consciously perceives a negative event as discriminatory and threatening, largely determines the impact that ED can have on target individuals. However, research has not yet considered how individual differences in both emotion regulation abilities, as indexed by resting high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), and rumination, a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, may predict PED in AAs. The following investigation examined this relationship in a sample of 101 college-aged students (45 AAs and 56 Caucasian Americans). Resting HF-HRV was assessed via electrocardiogram during a 5-minute-resting period. Rumination was assessed using the ruminative responses scale and everyday PED was assessed using the perceived ethnic discrimination questionnaire. Results showed a significant negative relationship between resting HF-HRV and PED in AAs only. Rumination significantly moderated this relationship, such that lower HF-HRV was related to higher PED only in AAs who reported moderate to higher, β = 0.417 (0.125), p {\textless} .01, levels of trait rumination. These results suggest that greater HF-HRV and lesser ruminative tendencies are key factors in reducing PED and therefore possibly, negative consequences associated with ED.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several publications are warning that the German language is no longer needed for transmission of scientific data. One of the causes may be the Impact Factor (IF), which appears to be derived predominantly from Anglo-American journals. The aim of this study was to check actual international attention paid to German-language journals, i. e. their citation frequencies in English-language papers. Are these citing rates in English-language articles correlated to the IF, and from where do citing articles originate?
METHODS: Of 25 arbitrarily selected {\textgreater}85 \% German-language medical journals, IF as well as language distributions of citing articles were determined by searching publication years 1995 - 2000 in Science Citation Index (SCI). MEDLINE and EMBASE were used as supplementary retrieval systems.
RESULTS: (i) The sample journals displayed an average IF = 0.357. A 99 \% correlation (Pearson factor r = 0.987; n = 25) was observed between our {\textgreater} constructed{\textless} IF 2000 and IF published in Journal Citation Report 2000. This proves Stegmann's IF determination method to be valid. On the average, 53 \% German-language and 45 \% English-language articles between 1995 - 2000 cited the 1995 - 1999' contributions of the studied journals. No correlation was observed between IF vs. rates of citing articles in English (r {\textless}0.1). 64 \% of citing English-language articles showed corporate sources in Germany/ Austria/ Switzerland, and 13.5 \% authors' institutions in USA.
CONCLUSIONS: (i) An IF {\textgreater}/=1 is, obviously, very hard to attain by German-language journals. ISI's differentiation between Citing vs. Cited-only Journals (the latter often serving as MEDLINE/ EMBASE sources) during derivation of IF appears unjustified. (ii) English now serves as the predominant communication language in sciences in German-speaking countries, but has not supplanted the German language. Our study reveals remarkable international attention rates remaining.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some randomised controlled trials (RCTs) done in German-speaking Europe are published in international English-language journals and others in national German-language journals. We assessed whether authors are more likely to report trials with statistically significant results in English than in German.
METHODS: We studied pairs of RCT reports, matched for first author and time of publication, with one report published in German and the other in English. Pairs were identified from reports round in a manual search of five leading German-language journals and from reports published by the same authors in English found on Medline. Quality of methods and reporting were assessed with two different scales by two investigators who were unaware of authors' identities, affiliations, and other characteristics of trial reports. Main study endpoints were selected by two investigators who were unaware of trial results. Our main outcome was the number of pairs of studies in which the levels of significance (shown by p values) were discordant.
FINDINGS: 62 eligible pairs of reports were identified but 19 (31\%) were excluded because they were duplicate publications. A further three pairs (5\%) were excluded because no p values were given. The remaining 40 pairs were analysed. Design characteristics and quality features were similar for reports in both languages. Only 35\% of German-language articles, compared with 62\% of English-language articles, reported significant (p {\textless} 0.05) differences in the main endpoint between study and control groups (p = 0.002 by McNemar's test). Logistic regression showed that the only characteristic that predicted publication in an English-language journal was a significant result. The odds ratio for publication of trials with significant results in English was 3.75 (95\% CI 1.25-11.3).
INTERPRETATION: Authors were more likely to publish RCTs in an English-language journal if the results were statistically significant. English language bias may, therefore, be introduced in reviews and meta-analyses if they include only trials reported in English. The effort of the Cochrane Collaboration to identify as many controlled trials as possible, through the manual search of many medical journals published in different languages will help to reduce such bias.},

In severe psychiatric disorders a more external locus of control is not specific to schizophrenia and after the acute phase is not associated with one particular diagnostic group. A more external locus of control is significantly related to fewer periods of recovery, to both depressed mood and psychosis, and to various aspects of personality.},

The 16-item instrument emerged from factor analysis of a large number of items and was found to possess high internal consistency and good test-retest reliability. The questionnaire correlates predictably with several psychological measures reasonably related to worry, and does not correlate with other measures more remote to the construct. Responses to the questionnaire are not influenced by social desirability. The measure was found to significantly discriminate college samples (a) who met all, some, or none of the DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder and (b) who met criteria for GAD vs posttraumatic stress disorder. Among 34 GAD-diagnosed clinical subjects, the worry questionnaire was found not to correlate with other measures of anxiety or depression, indicating that it is tapping an independent construct with severely anxious individuals, and coping desensitization plus cognitive therapy was found to produce significantly greater reductions in the measure than did a nondirective therapy condition.},

Subsequently, 52 Ss were selected for additional participation, and each completed 5 instruments: Irrational Beliefs Test, Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, Need for Cognition Scale, Thought Stopping Survey Schedule, and Ways of Coping Scale. Results indicate statistically significant main effects by problem-solving appraisal for all of the dependent variables. Ss who perceived themselves as effective problem solvers had more of a tendency to enjoy cognitive activities, higher self-concepts and lower self-criticism scores, lower frequencies of dysfunctional thoughts, fewer irrational beliefs, and coping styles that were less blameful and more problem focus than those Ss who perceived themselves as ineffective problem solvers. Results are related to W.

In a first session, 76 undergraduates predicted their grades prior to a midterm exam. In a second session, after having received feedback from the exam, they attempted to recall their predictions and predicted their grades on a second exam. Dysphoria was associated with hindsight bias whether initial predictions were overly optimistic or pessimistic. In the former case, the standard hindsight bias was modal for the sample, whereas a ‘reverse hindsight’ bias was modal in the latter. This asymmetry suggests that hindsight bias is influenced by motivational or affective factors. The bias did not hinder the improvement of predictions between the first and second exams, and therefore could not have mediated a hypothesized adaptive learning impairment among dysphoric subjects.},

Neuroticism appears to be the most powerful predictor of depression. Lower-order factors showing a significant and consistent relationship with depressive illness include dependency, self-criticism, obsessionality, and perfectionism. The links between depression and dependency and self-criticism have the strongest empirical support.ConclusionsSeveral personality dimensions are significantly associated with depressive illness, but the evidence that unequivocally demonstrates a true personality predisposition for depression is modest. Measures of personality may prove to be clinically useful for treatment selection.},

  abstract   = {Neuroticism's prospective association with common mental disorders (CMDs) has fueled the assumption that neuroticism is an independent etiologically informative risk factor. This vulnerability model postulates that neuroticism sets in motion processes that lead to CMDs. However, four other models seek to explain the association, including the spectrum model (manifestations of the same process), common cause model (shared determinants), state and scar models (CMD episode adds temporary/permanent neuroticism). To examine their validity we reviewed literature on confounding, operational overlap, stability and change, determinants, and treatment effects. None of the models is able to account for (virtually) all findings. The state and scar model cannot explain the prospective association. The spectrum model has some relevance, especially for internalizing disorders. Common causes are most important but the vulnerability model cannot be excluded although confounding of the prospective association by baseline symptoms and psychiatric history is substantial. In fact, some of the findings, such as interactions with stress and the small decay of neuroticism's effect over time, are consistent with the vulnerability model. We describe research designs that discriminate the remaining models and plea for deconstruction of neuroticism. Neuroticism is etiologically not informative yet but useful as an efficient marker of non-specified general risk.},

Depression was negatively correlated with inhibitory and activation controls when controlling for other negative emotional variables, and social anxiety was negatively correlated with attentional control when controlling for depression and state anxiety.

  abstract   = {Assessing and analysing individual differences in change over time is of central scientific importance to developmental neuroscience. However, the literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N = 204 (N = 32 imaging) on two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N = 176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and Ωnyx).},

  abstract   = {Emotions are an indispensable part of our mental life. The term emotion regulation refers to those processes that influence the generation, the experience and the expression of emotions. There is a great variety of strategies to regulate emotions efficiently, which are used in daily life and that have been investigated by cognitive neuroscience. Distraction guides attention to a secondary task. Reinterpretation, a variant of cognitive reappraisal, works by changing the meaning of an emotional stimulus. Detachment, another reappraisal strategy, refers to distancing oneself from an emotional stimulus, thereby reducing its personal relevance. Expressive Suppression modifies the behavioral or physiological response to an emotional stimulus. These four strategies are not equally effective in terms of emotion regulation success and have been shown to partly rely on different neuronal systems. Here, we compare for the first time the neural mechanisms of these typical strategies directly in a common functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of downregulation of negative emotions. Our results indicate that three of those strategies (Detachment, Expressive Suppression and Distraction) conjointly increase brain activation in a right prefronto-parietal regulation network and significantly reduce activation of the left amygdala. Compared to the other regulation strategies, Reinterpretation specifically recruited a different control network comprising left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal gyrus and was not effective in downregulation of the amygdala. We conclude that Detachment, Distraction and Expressive Suppression recruit very similar emotion regulation networks, whereas Reinterpretation is associated with activation of a qualitatively different network, making this regulation strategy a special one. Notably, Reinterpretation also proved to be the least effective strategy in neural terms, as measured by downregulation of amygdala activation.},

  abstract   = {A common and mostly effective emotion regulation strategy is reappraisal. During reappraisal, activity in cognitive control brain regions increases and activity in brain regions associated with emotion responding (e.g., the amygdala) diminishes. Immediately after reappraisal, it has been observed that activity in the amygdala increases again, which might reflect a paradoxical aftereffect. While there is extensive empirical evidence for these neural correlates of emotion regulation, only few studies targeted the association with individual differences in personality traits. The aim of this study is to investigate these associations more thoroughly. Seventy-six healthy participants completed measures of broad personality traits (Big Five, Positive and Negative Affect) as well as of more narrow traits (habitual use of emotion regulation) and performed an experimental fMRI reappraisal task. Participants were instructed to either permit their emotions or to detach themselves from the presented negative and neutral pictures. After each picture, a relaxation period was included. Reappraisal success was determined by arousal ratings and activity in the amygdala. During reappraisal, we found activation in the prefrontal cortex and deactivation in the left amygdala. During the relaxation period, an immediate aftereffect was found in occipital regions and marginally in the amygdala. Neither personality traits nor habitual use of emotion regulation predicted reappraisal success or the magnitude of the aftereffect. We replicated typical activation and deactivation patterns during intentional emotion regulation and partially replicated the immediate aftereffect in the amygdala. However, there was no association between personality traits and emotion regulation success.},

In this article, we aim to provide a clear explanation for the limited conditions under which standard procedures for mediation and moderation analysis can succeed. We discuss why reversing arrows or comparing model fit indices cannot tell us which model is the right one, and how tests of conditional independence can at least tell us where our model goes wrong. Causal modeling practices in psychology are far from optimal but may be kept alive by domain norms which demand that every article makes some novel claim about processes and boundary conditions. We end with a vision for a different research culture in which causal inference is pursued in a much slower, more deliberate and collaborative manner.},

In the section on panel designs, continuous time models and planned missing data models are introduced; these ideas will revolutionize the modeling and collection of panel data. In the section on growth curve models, the necessity of separately evaluating mean and covariance model fit is discussed. This section also introduces methods being used to carefully consider the time of measurements in temporal designs. Finally, the budding analysis of intensive within individual observations is considered, including recent work from mathematics that limits the generalizability of interindividual studies to individual outcomes.},

The usual method for achieving identification has been to fix one factor loading for each endogenous latent variable at unity. An alternative approach is to fix variances using newer constrained estimation algorithms. This article examines the philosophy behind such constraints and shows how their appropriate use is neither as straightforward nor as noncontroversial as portrayed in textbooks and computer manuals. The constraints on latent variable variances can interact with other model constraints to interfere with the testing of certain kinds of hypotheses and can yield incorrect standardized solutions with some popular software.

The OASIS images were collected from online sources, and valence and arousal ratings were obtained in an online study (total N = 822). The valence and arousal ratings covered much of the circumplex space and were highly reliable and consistent across gender groups. OASIS has four advantages: (a) the stimulus set contains a large number of images in four categories; (b) the data were collected in 2015, and thus OASIS features more current images and reflects more current ratings of valence and arousal than do existing stimulus sets; (c) the OASIS database affords users the ability to interactively explore images by category and ratings; and, most critically, (d) OASIS allows for free use of the images in online and offline research studies, as they are not subject to the copyright restrictions that apply to the International Affective Picture System.

The exploration of brain responses following inputs or in the context of state changes is crucial for a better understanding of the basic principles governing large-scale neuronal dynamics. State-of-the-art techniques allow EEG activity-from DC (direct current) up to high frequencies in the gamma range-to be acquired simultaneously with fMRI data. In the interleaved mode, spiking activities can also be assessed during concurrent fMRI. The utilization of fMRI evidence to better constrain solutions of the inverse problem of source localization of EEG activity is an exciting possibility. Nonetheless, this approach should be applied cautiously since the degree of overlap between underlying neuronal activity sources is variable and, for the most part, unknown. The ultimate goal is to make joint inferences about the activity, dynamics, and functions by exploiting complementary information from multimodal data sets.},

Here we review the methodologies that are currently available to address the challenges at each step of the data analysis pipeline. We start by surveying methods for pre-processing both EEG and fMRI data. On the EEG side, we focus on the correction for several MR-induced artifacts, particularly the gradient and pulse artifacts, as well as other sources of EEG artifacts. On the fMRI side, we consider image artifacts induced by the presence of EEG hardware inside the MR scanner, and the contamination of the fMRI signal by physiological noise of non-neuronal origin, including a review of several approaches to model and remove it. We then provide an overview of the approaches specifically employed for the integration of EEG and fMRI when using EEG to predict the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal, the so-called EEG-informed fMRI integration strategy, the most commonly used strategy in EEG-fMRI research. Finally, we systematically review methods used for the extraction of EEG features reflecting neuronal phenomena of interest.},

The statistical population included all undergraduate students at Payam-e Noor University in western areas of Iran during 2019- 2020 academic year (n=24000). A sample of 600 students were selected through randomized multistage cluster sampling based on Cochran’s formula. The participants used an AR application, and then completed an integrated questionnaire, which was a combination of 5 questionnaires (flow, perceived enjoyment, need for cognition, cognitive absorption and self-efficacy). A total of 556 questionnaires were returned. The data were analyzed through path analysis using Amos 22, Lisrel 8.50 and Spss 22. Results: Among the direct effects, self-efficacy had the highest effect on perceived enjoyment (0.28) and need for cognition had the lowest effect on self-efficacy (0.16). On the other hand, cognitive absorption had the highest indirect effect on perceived enjoyment (0.13) and the lowest indirect effects were those of the need for cognition on flow (0.04) and self-efficacy on flow (0.04). The highest total effect was related to the effect of self-efficacy on perceived enjoyment (0.28) and the lowest one was related to the effect of selfefficacy on flow (0.04). Conclusion: The results obtained for the fit indices of the proposed model showed that it had a good fit with the data collected from the respondents (X2 =22.14, P=0.179, CFI=0.99, GFI=0.99, AGFI=0.98 \& RMSEA=0.023). Accordingly, this model can provide educators and education leaders with critical information for improving learning outcomes.},

The sample consists of 406 social science students (34.1\% first-year, 27.6\% second-year, 16.7\% third-year and 21.6\% are fourth-year students). They completed: (a) the Approaches to Learning and Studying Inventory (ALSI) (b) the Student Experience of Emotions Inventory (c) the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (d) the Need for Cognition-short form and (e) the Sense of Coherence Scale. The pace of study was assessed by the courses they failed. The statistical analysis used CFA, Cluster Analysis, MANOVA, Discriminant analysis and the Decision tree model. The study suggests the contribution of Sense of Coherence and Need for Cognition to students learning and supports recent suggestions about the crucial role of trait characteristics and mental health in learning. The findings reveal four students’ profiles: (a) surface-unorganized students (b) deep organized students (c) high dissonant students with a low sense of coherence and (d) moderate dissonant students with low need for cognition. In addition, first-year students are most likely to report increased level of failures. The findings are discussed in relation to recent literature.},

Through an online survey, participants viewed one of four messages: a personalized behavior feedback message, a generic feedback message that contained a memory prompt, a generic feedback message that did not contain a memory prompt, and no message. Pre- and post-intervention measures of specialty coffee drink consumption and participants’ likelihood to reduce their consumption were recorded, and participants’ levels of Need for Cognition were also assessed. Although each of the three behavior feedback messages were successful at encouraging reduced specialty coffee drink consumption compared to the no message control, an interaction effect between Need for Cognition Scale scores and behavior feedback message condition was not established, suggesting that no differences in post-intervention consumption intention were established between individuals of varying levels of Need for Cognition when presented with differing forms of behavior feedback persuasive messages. Furthermore, Need for Cognition predicted both post-intervention specialty coffee consumption intention and likelihood of reducing consumption "in the next few days," but in a surprising manner. Clarification of these results, limitations of the study's methodology, and future research possibilities are also discussed.},

Design/methodology/approach Data were obtained using a time-lagged design. The final sample includes 350 researchers from 64 scientific research teams. Findings The results indicate that the need for cognition is positively associated with individual creativity. Furthermore, this study suggests that perceived organizational support for creativity can complement an individual's need for cognition when it comes to individual creativity. This indicates a synergistic pattern. On the other hand, psychological safety can substitute for an individual's need for cognition when influencing individual creativity. Thus, a diminishing-gains pattern also exists. Practical implications The results suggest that when individuals are stuck in environments of low psychological safety, yet perceive higher levels of organizational support for creativity, their levels of creativity can be boosted. Originality/value This study is among one of the first to explore a supportive context's complementary or substitution effect on positive personality traits by demonstrating the complementary effect of perceived organizational support for creativity and the substitution effect of psychological safety. This study validates the positive effect of the need for cognition on creativity. This study also enriches the psychological safety literature by showing that psychological safety is not always necessary for individuals with a high need for cognition.},

We sought further active ingredients and crucial factors for deep processing during an example-based training intervention, which consisted mainly of video examples and self-explanation prompts. In Experiment 1, we analyzed whether presenting learning goals influenced learning processes (i.e. mental effort and self-explanation quality) and learning outcomes (i.e. declarative knowledge about argumentation). In Experiment 2, we examined the role of the ratio between the number of self-explanation and practice tasks. Both experiments revealed that learners highly improved their declarative knowledge on argumentation. These effects remained stable after 2 and 3 weeks—regardless of whether learning goals had been presented or the ratio between self-explanation and practice tasks. Furthermore, mental effort and the Need for Cognition (NFC) were identified and discussed as crucial factors for deep processing the given examples and for the knowledge gain from pretest to delayed posttests. Presenting learning goals reduced mental effort, albeit at the expense of beneficial cognitive processing of the given examples. Finally, NFC contributed to learners’ mental engagement not only during but also after the training intervention.},

Several potential explanations for this relationship have been offered in the literature, one of which is that a third variable accounts for this relationship. The current study examines this hypothesis by testing need for cognition (NfC), self-rated health, physical activity, cognitive activity, emotional stability, and conscientiousness as mediators of the relationship between cognitive ability (g) and indices of well-being. Data were drawn from the Virginia Cognitive Aging Project, a study of community-dwelling adults aged 18–99 (N = 4354). A composite variable representing cognition was created using measures of episodic memory, perceptual speed, reasoning ability, and spatial visualization. SWB was conceptualized as life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect; the three facets of SWB were treated as separate outcomes. Results indicate that NfC, self-rated health, emotional stability, and conscientiousness partially mediate the relationship between cognition and all facets of SWB. Neither physical activity nor cognitive activity mediated the relationship between cognition and SWB. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the cognition-SWB relationship can partially be explained by third variables and provide insight into the personality and individual difference characteristics that underlie this relationship.},

Participants completed scales of social distancing compliance, mask-wearing behavior and attitude, need for cognition, self-control, risk attitude, and political ideology. Epidemiological information (seven-day positive rate and the number of cases per 100,000) was obtained based on the state participants resided in. As a result, epidemiological information did not correlate with social distancing compliance mask-wearing. Political ideology, on the other hand, was a significant factor, with a more liberal tendency being associated with greater engagement in social distancing compliance and mask-wearing behavior an attitude. Importantly, those who were more risk averse, or had a higher level of self-control or need for cognition practiced more social distancing and mask-wearing, after controlling for demographics, epidemiological information, and political ideology. Furthermore, for mask-wearing behavior, political ideology interacted with both need for cognition and self-control. Collectively, the study revealed the psychological roots of individual differences in social distancing and mask-wearing compliance.},

However, the question arises whether this is equally true for all students or whether there are students for whom having adequately challenging schoolwork is even more important than for others. In this study, we investigated whether students' cognitive ability and their need for cognition (i.e., their tendency to actively seek, engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activity) affects students' motivational responses to adequately challenging schoolwork. Building on data from a large-scale survey among 3002 Flemish 7th graders, we found that adequately challenging schoolwork had a more favorable effect on intrinsic motivation and schoolwork engagement for students high in need for cognition than for students low in need for cognition. Student cognitive ability did not moderate the association between adequate challenge and motivational outcomes.

This paper explores the factors influencing the learning motivation of master candidates of economic management (EM), drawing on the theory of the NFC. A questionnaire survey was conducted on the NFC, the scale and the learning motivation of 233 EM master candidates from several universities in southwestern China. The survey results were analyzed in details. It is concluded that, for EM master candidates, the NFC has a significant positive correlation with active and passive learning motivations; their learning motivation is promoted by both internal drives and external factors. On this basis, the authors gave instructions on the education of EM master candidates.},

Yet relatively little research has examined the conditional effects of mastery goal structure. Within the context of health education, we investigated whether the relations of mastery goal structure to a student's motivation to learn would be moderated by individual differences in the enjoyment and engagement of effortful cognitive activity—the need for cognition (NC). Data were collected from 660 high school students at two time points during semester-long health education courses. Consistent with our predictions, results indicate that the relation between mastery goal structure and increases in students' academic self-concept and values over time is stronger for low NC students and weaker for high NC students. The present study bridges applied research on classroom motivation with basic attitudes research—demonstrating that students' motivation to learn is a joint function of their perceptions of achievement-related messages provided by teachers and preferences for engaging in cognitively demanding activities.},

Data analysis was performedvia Pearson correlation analysis, simple and multiple regressionanalyses, and Sobel test equation for mediation effects.Analyses revealed the significant positive correlationof general self-efficacy with the need for cognition andacademic performance as well as the significant inversecorrelation of academic burnout with the need for cognition,general self-efficacy, and academic performance.However, the need for cognition was not significantly correlatedwith academic performance. Moreover, the needfor cognition and general self-efficacy simultaneously predicted16.8\% of the variance of academic burnout, whileonly general self-efficacy was the significant predictor ofacademic performance, accounting for 3.5\% of its totalvariance. General self-efficacy mediated the relationshipof the need for cognition and academic burnout. Also,the need for cognition mediated the relationship of generalself-efficacy and academic burnout (P {\textless} 0.001).

  abstract   = {Computer-tailored interventions, which deliver health messages adjusted based on characteristics of the message recipient, can effectively improve a range of health behaviours. Typically, the content of the message is tailored to user demographics, health behaviours and social cognitive factors (e.g., intentions, attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived social support) to increase message relevance, and thus the extent to which the message is read, considered and translated into attitude and behaviour change. Some researchers have suggested that the efficacy of computer-tailored interventions may be further enhanced by adapting messages to suit recipients' need for cognition (NFC) - a personality trait describing how individuals tend to process information. However, the likely impact of doing so, especially when tailored in conjunction with other variables, requires further consideration. It is possible that intervention effects may be reduced in some circumstances due to interactions with other variables (e.g., perceived relevance) that also influence information processing. From a practical point of view, it is also necessary to consider how to optimally operationalise and measure NFC if it is to be a useful tailoring variable. This paper aims to facilitate further research in this area by critically examining these issues based on relevant theories and existing evidence.},

Theoretically interesting is the finding that the cartoon message is more effective in bringing about change in attitudes and subjective norms than the written message for low-NFC adolescents, and that the written message is more effective than the cartoon message for high-NFC adolescents.

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a non-invasive marker of the influence of the myelinated vagal fibers on the heart, and heart period were collected during the presentation of film clips of varying emotional content. The BPD and control groups had similar initial levels of RSA and heart period. However, during the experiment the groups exhibited contrasting trajectories, with the BPD group decreasing RSA and heart period and the control group increasing RSA and heart period. By the end of the experiment, the groups differ significantly on both RSA and heart period. The correlation between the changes in RSA and heart period was significant only for the control group, suggesting that vagal mechanisms mediated the heart period responses only in the control group. The findings were consistent with the Polyvagal Theory [Porges, S. W. (1995). Orienting in a defensive world: Mammalian modifications of our evolutionary heritage: A Polyvagal Theory. Psychophysiology, 32, 301–318; Porges, S. W. (2001). The Polyvagal Theory: Phylogenetic substrates of a social nervous system. International Journal of Psychophysiology, 42, 123–146; Porges, S. W. (2003). Social engagement and attachment: A phylogenetic perspective. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1008, 31–47.], illustrating different adaptive shifts in autonomic state throughout the course of the experiment. The BPD group ended in a physiological state that supports the mobilization behaviors of fight and flight, while the control group ended in a physiological state that supports social engagement behaviors. These finding are consistent with other published studies demonstrating atypical vagal regulation of the heart with other psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract   = {The present study addressed autonomic nervous system (ANS) patterning during experimentally manipulated emotion. Film clips previously shown to induce amusement, anger, contentment, disgust, fear and sadness, in addition to a neutral control film, were presented to 34 college-aged subjects while skin conductance, blood pressure and the electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded, as was self-reported affect. Both mean of and mean successive difference of heart period were derived from the ECG. Pattern classification analyses revealed emotion-specific autonomic patterning for all emotion conditions except disgust; all emotion conditions exhibited significant patterning using self-report. Discriminant function analysis was used to describe the location of discrete emotions within dimensional affective space using both self-report and ANS variables. Findings suggest that the dimensions of valence and activation portray the structure of self-reported emotion, but that valence is more accurately described as approach–withdrawal when applied to autonomic responses during discrete emotions. The findings provide further support for the existence of emotion-specific ANS activity, and are consistent with a hybrid discrete–dimensional model of affective space.},

Concurrent estimates of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF; obtained by positron emission tomography), heart period, and high-frequency heart period variability (HF-HPV; an indicator of cardiac parasympathetic activity) were examined in 93 adults (aged 50–70 years) who performed a series of increasingly difficult working-memory tasks. Increased task difficulty resulted in decreased heart period (indicating cardioacceleration) and decreased HF-HPV (indicating decreased cardiac parasympathetic activity). Task-induced decreases in heart period and HF-HPV were associated with concurrent increases and decreases in rCBF to cortical and subcortical brain regions that are speculated to regulate cardiac autonomic activity during behavioral processes: the medial-prefrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices, the amygdala–hippocampal complex, and the cerebellum. These findings replicate and extend a small number of functional neuroimaging studies that suggest an important role for both cortical and subcortical brain systems in human cardiac autonomic regulation.},

The presentation of a sequence of either pleasant or unpleasant pictures, as emotional primers, preceded the speech stress. Heart period was measured throughout the experiment. Stress induced tachycardia irrespective of emotional priming or traits. In the recovery period, participants with higher resting cardiac vagal tone or presenting higher resilience significantly reduced the heart acceleration. Furthermore, these traits interacted synergistically in the promotion of the recovery of heart period. Pleasant priming also improved recovery for participants with lower negative affect. In conclusion, the stress recovery measured through heart period seemed dependent upon individual predispositions and emotional priming.

The SRIS-IN was negatively correlated with depression, anxiety, stress and alexithymia, and positively correlated with cognitive flexibility and self-regulation.

Although reflection is thought to be associated with problem solving and the promotion of mental health, previous researches have shown that reflection does not always have an adaptive effect on depression. Authors have examined the causes behind this inconsistency by modeling the relationships among self-reflection, self-rumination, and depression. One hundred and eleven undergraduates (91 men and 20 women) participated in a two-time point assessment with a 3-week interval. Statistical analysis with structural equation modeling showed that self-reflection significantly predicted self-rumination, whereas self-rumination did not predict self-reflection. With regard to depression, self-reflection was associated with a lower level of depression; self-rumination, with a higher level of depression. The total effect of self-reflection on depression was almost zero. This result indicates that self-reflection per se has an adaptive effect, which is canceled out by the maladaptive effect of self-rumination, because reflectors are likely to ruminate and reflect simultaneously.},

  abstract  = {Objectives: Future thinking is an important domain of cognitive functioning, with reduced ability to imagine positive future events associated with hopelessness in depression and parasuicide. Rumination has been shown to exacerbate negative cognitive biases in depression, and to reduce likelihood estimations for positive future events. We examine the hypothesis that, in depressed patients, rumination would reduce the ability to imagine positive future events, whilst increasing the ability to imagine negative future events. Method: The ability to imagine positive and negative future events was assessed using the future thinking paradigm (MacLeod, Rose, \& Williams, 1993). Depressed and nondepressed participants completed the future thinking task after being randomly allocated to either a rumination or distraction manipulation (Nolen-Hoeksema \& Morrow, 1993). Mood was measured before and after the manipulation. Participants also completed a standard verbal fluency task. Results: In the depressed group, compared to distraction, rumination increased both negative and positive future thinking, although the effect was only significant for negative future thinking once baseline levels of hopelessness were controlled for. These findings are consistent with the prediction that rumination would increase negative future thinking, but inconsistent with the prediction that rumination would reduce positive future thinking. Previous findings that, compared to controls, depressed patients generated fewer positive future events were replicated. Conclusion: Ruminative self-focus leads to greater negative future thinking in depressed patients, further confirming that rumination exacerbates negative cognitive biases in depression. The relationship between rumination and positive future thinking was unexpected, but might potentially reflect a general priming of self-related information by rumination.},

Currently over 80 publications using IPIP scales are listed at the IPIP Web site (http://ipip.ori.org), and the rate of IPIP-related publications has been increasing rapidly. The growing popularity of the IPIP can be attributed to five factors: (1) It is cost free; (2) its items can be obtained instantaneously via the Internet; (3) it includes over 2000 items, all easily available for inspection; (4) scoring keys for IPIP scales are provided; and (5) its items can be presented in any order, interspersed with other items, reworded, translated into other languages, and administered on the World Wide Web without asking permission of anyone. The unrestricted availability of the IPIP raises concerns about possible misuse by unqualified persons, and the freedom of researchers to use the IPIP in idiosyncratic ways raises the possibility of fragmentation rather than scientific unification in personality research.},

We demonstrate that by separating Ncog and Nchange and cross-classifying individuals based on these attributes, 4 unique patterns of change behavior emerge. A large-scale choice study was conducted by surveying metropolitan residents about changes in telecommunication services (local, long distance, and cellular). We use a latent class model to uncover the segmentation structure in the choice data, using the constructs as concommitant variables in the segment classification portion of the econometric model. The results show that the predicted theoretical structure explains observed data and can be used to significantly increase the predictive power of models of change behavior.},

  abstract = {INTRO: Need for Cognition (NFC) refers to a personality trait describing the relatively stable intrinsic motivation of individuals to invest cognitive effort in cognitive endeavors. Higher NFC is associated with a more elaborated, central information processing style and increased recruitment of resources in cognitively demanding situations. To further clarify the association between cognitive resources and NFC, we examined in two studies how NFC relates to executive functions as basic cognitive abilities.
METHODS: In Study 1, 189 healthy young adults completed a NFC scale and a battery of six commonly used inhibitory control tasks (Stroop, antisaccade, stop-signal, flanker, shape-matching, word-naming). In Study 2, 102 healthy young adults completed the NFC scale and two tasks for each of the three executive functions inhibitory control (go-nogo, stop-signal), shifting (number-letter, color-shape) and working memory updating (two-back, letter-memory).
RESULTS: Using a Bayesian approach to correlation analysis, we found no conclusive evidence that NFC was related to any executive function measure. Instead, we obtained even moderate evidence for the null hypothesis.
CONCLUSION: Both studies add to more recent findings that shape the understanding of NFC as a trait that is less characterized by increased cognitive control abilities but rather by increased willingness to invest effort and exert self-control via motivational processes.},

During the quarter the students completed three projects, in which they explained the social-psychological principles they thought were illustrated in self-selected materials. The projects were scored on elaborative processing, i.e., the use of relevant, cogent, and detailed explanations. NFCS and elaboration orientation scores were then correlated with the summated scores from three multiple-choice tests. Results indicate that students high in need for cognition achieved more academically than those low in need for cognition, because the former were more effective information processors.},

  abstract   = {Procrastination is prevalent among students and is associated with negative outcomes, including poor academic performance and psychological distress. Research also suggests that anxiety and depression can exacerbate procrastination; however, the mechanisms associated with the development of procrastination are less understood. The current study aimed to clarify the role of negative repetitive thought (i.e., rumination and worry) in the links between anxiety and procrastination, and depression and procrastination. Ninety-one undergraduate students completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, worry, brooding rumination, and procrastination, and two multiple mediator models were tested. Procrastination was positively correlated with the study variables, including medium effects for anxiety and depression, a large effect for rumination, and a small effect for worry. Rumination independently mediated the relationships between anxiety and procrastination, and depression and procrastination. Worry did not independently mediate these relationships. The current findings suggest rumination plays a larger role in the links between anxiety, depression, and procrastination than worry. Thus, students with higher levels of anxiety and depression engage in more negative repetitive thought, which may contribute to procrastinatory behavior as a result of a preoccupation with depressing or painful thoughts about the past.},

  abstract = {Individual differences researchers very commonly report Pearson correlations between their variables of interest. Cohen (1988) provided guidelines for the purposes of interpreting the magnitude of a correlation, as well as estimating power. Specifically, r=0.10, r=0.30, and r=0.50 were recommended to be considered small, medium, and large in magnitude, respectively. However, Cohen's effect size guidelines were based principally upon an essentially qualitative impression, rather than a systematic, quantitative analysis of data. Consequently, the purpose of this investigation was to develop a large sample of previously published meta-analytically derived correlations which would allow for an evaluation of Cohen's guidelines from an empirical perspective. Based on 708 meta-analytically derived correlations, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponded to correlations of 0.11, 0.19, and 0.29, respectively. Based on the results, it is suggested that Cohen's correlation guidelines are too exigent, as {\textless}3\% of correlations in the literature were found to be as large as r=0.50. Consequently, in the absence of any other information, individual differences researchers are recommended to consider correlations of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 as relatively small, typical, and relatively large, in the context of a power analysis, as well as the interpretation of statistical results from a normative perspective.},

Based on the results of 3 primary tests, the NFCS—C included 18 items and a 6-point scale. Ss completed the Hidden Figures Test, the NFCS—C, and other scales associated with dogmatism, social desirability, worry/emotionality, social anxiety, individual-oriented and social-oriented achievement motives, internal–external locus of control, self-monitoring, social skills, and social esteem. Ss' personal data, leisure time activities (intellectual or nonintellectual), and media use (TV, radio, or written form) were collected. The reliability of the NFCS—C was tested in a study of internal consistency and test–retest reliability. The validity of the NFCS—C was tested by analyzing internal structure, by using the relationship between need for cognition and other constructs, and by discriminating between Ss with high and low need for cognition.

Recent experimental evidence is suggestive of individual differences in the dispositional willingness to invest cognitive effort in goal-directed behavior. The traits need for cognition (NFC) and self-control are related to behavioral measures of cognitive effort discounting and demand avoidance, respectively. Given that these traits are only moderately related, the question arises whether they reflect a common core factor underlying cognitive effort investment. If so, the common core of both traits might be related to behavioral measures of effort discounting in a more systematic fashion. To address this question, we aimed at specifying a core construct of cognitive effort investment that reflects dispositional differences in the willingness and tendency to exert effortful control.},

Four waves of data were collected from 117 Hong Kong youths (24.0\% female, mean age = 17.7) over one year. Latent change score analysis was employed to examine the univairate and bivariate changes of their perceived stress and life satisfaction. Results suggest a positive growth trajectory in life satisfaction over time. The results of perceived stress were less conclusive. Bivariate models indicated that the previous level of life satisfaction was negatively linked to the subsequent perceived stress level but not vice versa.

  abstract    = {Need for Cognition (NFC) describes one’s inclination towards and enjoyment of effortful cognitive activities and has been associated with favourable academic outcomes. Yet, recent evidence also points to beneficial outcomes regarding wellbeing. This review gives an overview of the literature on the role of NFC in wellbeing in adults. Higher NFC was found to be associated with lower neuroticism, higher positive affect and life satisfaction, a more stable identity and higher social confidence, while associations with addictive behaviours and physical health were inconsistent. One mechanism driving these patterns seems to be a higher perceived control in individuals with higher NFC that results in lower depression and burnout via active coping, but also in a reduced effectiveness of health interventions when there was an imbalance between perceived resources and challenges. Thus, this review provides a leverage point for future research on NFC and wellbeing to improve prevention and intervention.

Dieser erlaubt es, Präferenzen für zwei häufig angewandte Strategien zur Emotionsregulation, nämlich Unterdrückung (suppression) und Neubewertung (reappraisal) zu erfassen. Die deutsche Version wurde in drei Übersetzungsschritten an jeweils einer Gruppe von Studenten (n = 113/167/174) erprobt. Dabei stand eine möglichst enge Orientierung am englischen Original sowie die Optimierung der Faktoren-Ladungen auf die zwei Komponenten im Vordergrund. Eine Faktorenanalyse mit iterativer Kommunalitätenschätzung und Varimax-Rotation wurde verwendet. Entsprechend unserem Ziel erreichten die Alpha-Werte (innere Konsistenz) als Reliabilitätsmaß für Unterdrückung und Neubewertung die Durchschnittswerte des amerikanischen Originalfragebogens. Wir entwickelten ein Instrument, das einfach und in kurzer Zeit (5–10 min) zu beantworten ist und differenziert die beiden Emotionsregulationsstile Neubewertung und Suppression erfasst. Mögliche Anwendungsbereiche sind die Untersuchung von Depressionen und Angsterkrankungen und die Bewertung psychotherapeutischer Verfahren.},

Datengrundlage bildet eine repräsentative Stichprobe der bundesdeutschen Bevölkerung aus dem Jahr 2004. Die teststatistische Prüfung verweist auf gute psychometrische Eigenschaften des EUROHIS-QOL Index. Obgleich Modifikationsmöglichkeiten bestehen, wird die Selektion von Items ausgeschlossen, weil dies den komzeptuellen Vorgaben der Indexkonstruktion widersprechen würde. Die Ergebnisse der teststatistischen Prüfung des WHO-5 sind hinsichtlich der psychometrischen Eigenschaften als ausgezeichnet einzuschätzen. Erstmals werden geschlechts- und altersgruppenspezifische Normwerte für die deutschsprachigen Versionen der beiden Instrumente vorgelegt.},

However, these studies have primarily focused only on models with a single mediator and 2 component paths. To address this limitation, a simulation was conducted to evaluate these alternative methods in a more complex path model with multiple mediators and indirect paths with 2 and 3 paths. Methods for testing contrasts of 2 effects were evaluated also. The simulation included 1 exogenous independent variable, 3 mediators and 2 outcomes and varied sample size, number of paths in the mediated effects, test used to evaluate effects, effect sizes for each path, and the value of the contrast. Confidence intervals were used to evaluate the power and Type I error rate of each method, and were examined for coverage and bias. The bias-corrected bootstrap had the least biased confidence intervals, greatest power to detect nonzero effects and contrasts, and the most accurate overall Type I error. All tests had less power to detect 3-path effects and more inaccurate Type I error compared to 2-path effects. Confidence intervals were biased for mediated effects, as found in previous studies. Results for contrasts did not vary greatly by test, although resampling approaches had somewhat greater power and might be preferable because of ease of use and flexibility.},

Inhibiting emotion-expressive behavior is thought to be less beneficial due to later implementation, but empirical results are mixed. Thus, the current study examined the temporal dynamics of these emotion regulation strategies at attenuating the late positive potential (LPP) while participants were shown unpleasant pictures. Results revealed that all strategies successfully reduced the LPP and self-reported negative affect. We confirmed that distraction attenuated the LPP earlier than cognitive reappraisal. Surprisingly, expressive suppression affected emotional responding as early as distraction. This suggests that suppression was used preventively and disrupted the emotion-generative process from the very beginning instead of targeting the emotional response itself. Thus, the obtained results point to the importance of considering the point in time when response-focused emotion regulation strategies are being implemented.},

  abstract   = {Boredom at work is a state of employee unwell-being that is characterized by relatively low arousal and high dissatisfaction. At present little is known about boredom at work. In order to facilitate future research, the current study introduces a brief self-report questionnaire that assesses boredom at work, the Dutch Boredom Scale (DUBS). We argue that (1) boredom at work can be distinguished empirically from related concepts such as work engagement and job burnout; (2) boredom at work results from having an unchallenging, “passive” job; and (3) the subsequent lack of challenge in the form of boredom may result in dissatisfaction with the job and with the organization. Using data from 6315 employees, factor analysis supported the factorial and discriminant validity of the DUBS vis-à-vis engagement and burnout. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed that demands and resources were negatively associated with boredom. Moreover, boredom at work was negatively related with job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and positively with turnover intention. These findings support the validity of the DUBS. Future research may focus on underemployment as an antecedent of boredom at work, and on the effects of boredom on job performance.},

Despite recent changes in technology and the organization of work, boredom remains a part of the experience of work. The available evidence indicates that boredom is associated mainly with negative individual and organizational outcomes. The authors organize the review of the antecedents of boredom around four major themes in the literature: boredom in relation to jobs; individual differences; social context; and goals and coping. The authors conclude that the major challenge for researchers is to provide an integrative account of boredom which subsumes multiple areas of research, and that one most promising avenue for future research requires further attention to boredom in relation to coping processes, pursuit and attainment of personal goals.

Analyses in both samples support one structure. The final scales have acceptable internal reliability. The unique explanatory power of each scale is suggested by partial correlations with theoretically related variables. Confirmatory factor analysis indicates that the five factor solution has a better fit with the data than other first order solutions with fewer factors. Second order factor analysis shows that two superordinate factors, corresponding to negative and positive affect can account for the relationships amongst the five first order factors.

The objective of the current study is to analyze the role of professional self-efficacy as a predictor of psychosocial well-being (i.e., burnout and engagement) following the Social Cognitive Theory of Albert Bandura (1997). Structural Equation Modeling was performed in a sample of secondary school teachers (n = 460) and users of Information and Communication Technology (n = 596). Results show empirical support for the predicting role that professional self-efficacy plays in the perception of challenge (i.e., mental overload) and hindrance demands (i.e., role conflict, lack of control, and lack of social support), which are in turn related to burnout (i.e., erosion process) and engagement (i.e., motivational process). Specifically, employees with more professional self-efficacy will perceive more challenge demands and fewer hindrance demands, and this will in turn relate to more engagement and less burnout. A multi-group analysis showed that the research model was invariant across both samples. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

This study explores the burnout process beyond the individual level of analysis and integrates Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) with the Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R), emphasizing the role of self-efficacy in shaping the meaning that people ascribe to situations. A multilevel structural equation model was tested in which it was predicted that work self-efficacy beliefs would be associated with burnout both directly and indirectly via job demands and job resources, and at both the individual and the team level. Moreover, it was posited that, at the team level, registered sickness absences are predicted by burnout. A sample of 5406 call centre operators, clustered in 186 teams working in the same large Italian company, filled out a questionnaire, whereas team absence rates were provided by the company's HR department. The findings largely supported the hypothesized model: at both levels, job demands and job resources partially mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and burnout. Moreover, at the team level, burnout predicted subsequent sickness absenteeism. In addition, individual-level burnout was primarily associated with job demands, whereas team-level burnout was primarily associated with a lack of team-level resources.},

Individual differences in subjective effort could present a major and pervasive confound in behavioral and neuroscience assessments, by conflating cognitive ability with cognitive motivation. Self-report cognitive effort scales have been developed, but objective measures are lacking. In this study, we use the behavioral economic approach of revealed preferences to quantify subjective effort. Specifically, we adapted a well-established discounting paradigm to measure the extent to which cognitive effort causes participants to discount monetary rewards. The resulting metrics are sensitive to both within-individual factors, including objective load and reward amount, and between-individual factors, including age and trait cognitive engagement. We further validate cognitive effort discounting by benchmarking it against well-established measures of delay discounting. The results highlight the promise and utility of behavioral economic tools for assessing trait and state influences on cognitive motivation.},

Moreover, it is not yet clear which motivational processes are most essential for academic achievement. The current study considered how an array of motivational processes related to academic achievement, controlling for intelligence and personality, in a large sample of Flemish seventh graders. Students’ intelligence and need for cognition, that is, the personal preference to engage in cognitively demanding work, proved to be strong predictors of academic achievement. Yet, even after controlling for intelligence and personality, several motivational processes explained additional, unique variance in achievement, totaling about a quarter of the explained variance in school results. In particular, academic self-concept proved to relate most strongly to achievement, while achievement goals, achievement motivation, autonomous motivation, and effort beliefs additionally explained a unique portion of the variance in academic achievement. Although these findings were largely consistent across different operationalizations of achievement, motivational constructs explained more variance when achievement was measured with school grades instead of standardized tests. Given the more malleable nature of motivational dynamics compared with intelligence and personality differences, the unique, positive associations between motivation and achievement suggest that improving student motivation is a worthwhile undertaking.

Here, we examine whether character measures display incremental validity over and above the Big Five Inventory and measures of fluid intelligence when predicting academic performance in a large sample (N = 1,583) of 3rd through 8th grade students. The results indicate that multiple character measures demonstrate incremental prediction, particularly need for cognition (ΔR2=6.5\% over personality, ΔR2=2.5\% over personality and fluid intelligence) and school value (ΔR2=4.2\% over personality). Applying regularization techniques to identify a parsimonious solution, both coefficients for need for cognition and school value remained non-zero and accounted for unique variance. The incremental predictive power of individual character measures was primarily due to common variance across the character measures (ΔR2=11.5\% over personality, 9.3\% over personality and fluid intelligence). Educationally-contextualized measures have utility for predicting achievement in addition to decontextualized behavioral and ability measures.},

Current conceptualizations of stress are challenged as being too phenomenological and ambiguous, and consequently, not given to direct empirical testing. Indeed, it is argued that researchers have tended to avoid the problem of defining stress, choosing to study stress without reference to a clear framework. A new stress model called the model of conservation of resources is presented as an alternative. This resource-oriented model is based on the supposition that people strive to retain, protect, and build resources and that what is threatening to them is the potential or actual loss of these valued resources. Implications of the model of conservation of resources for new research directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In large part, the decision to parcel or not depends on one's philosophical stance regarding scientific inquiry (e.g., empiricist vs. pragmatist) and the substantive goal of a study (e.g., to understand the structure of a set of items or to examine the nature of a set of constructs). Prior to creating parcels, however, we recommend strongly that investigators acquire a thorough understanding of the nature and dimensionality of the items to be parceled. With this knowledge in hand, various techniques for creating parcels can be utilized to minimize potential pitfalls and to optimize the measurement structure of constructs in SEM procedures. A number of parceling techniques are described, noting their strengths and weaknesses.},

In the present article, 11 methods for constructing the confidence intervals (CIs) of the standardized indirect effects were evaluated via a computer simulation. These included six Wald CIs, three bootstrap CIs, one likelihood-based CI, and the PRODCLIN CI. The results consistently showed that the percentile bootstrap, the bias-corrected bootstrap, and the likelihood-based approaches had the best coverage probability.

Earlier work on evaluating this assumption considered either exclusively non-normal error score distributions, or limited conditions. In view of this and the availability of advanced methods for generating univariate non-normal data, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to show that non-normal distributions for true or error scores do create problems for using alpha to estimate the internal consistency reliability. The sample coefficient alpha is affected by leptokurtic true score distributions, or skewed and/or kurtotic error score distributions.

Previous research has predominantly investigated the neuroendocrine correlates of stress appraisal in laboratory contexts during acute demanding situations. We tested whether the psychoneuroendocrinology of stress appraisals can also be investigated in naturalistic trans-contextual everyday life settings. Forty-two participants produced five daily saliva samples and provided concurrent questionnaire data on subjective stress, demands, resources, and the threat-challenge continuum over the course of five days (69\% female; mean age = 22.8, range = 18-30 years). Momentary salivary cortisol and alpha amylase were predicted with three-level autoregressive linear mixed models. We found that both momentary cortisol and alpha amylase were elevated during higher subjective stress. In contrast, cortisol was not significantly related to a bipolar threat-challenge indicator. Moreover within-person response surface analyses showed no effect of the mismatch between demands and resources on either physiological stress indicator, but confirmed theoretically proposed effects on subjective threat-challenge, which was replicated in another intensive longitudinal (N = 61) and a large cross-sectional sample (N = 1194). In sum, our study (a) suggests robust relations between subjective stress and HPA/SAM axis activity on a moment-to-moment basis and (b) confirms theoretical predictions concerning stress appraisal and the mismatch between demands and resources on a psychological level. In contrast, no neuroendocrine patterns of threat-challenge were found, suggesting that neuroendocrine patterns might be context-specific and do not apply to a general demand-resource imbalance in everyday life.},

Several studies have suggested that increasing the effort required decreases the subjective value of a reward. Nevertheless, the nature of effort that results in discounting, discounting in a loss situation, and individual consistency in effort aversion across different types of effort have all remained unclear. Therefore, the present study examined whether physical, emotional, and cognitive efforts induce discounting of subjective reward value under two hypothetical situations. In the gain situation, participants made a choice about engaging in effortful work to obtain a reward, whereas in the loss situation they paid a reward to another person to do the work. The results demonstrated that increasing physical, emotional, and cognitive effort caused discounting of the subjective reward value in both situations. Additionally, the results suggested a relatively high degree of individual consistency in effort aversion in each situation, and a moderate degree of consistency across the two situations.},

  abstract = {Motivational deficits in schizophrenia are proposed to be attributable in part to abnormal effort-cost computations. Inflated subjective cognitive effort costs may explain diminished functioning in schizophrenia to the extent that they drive avoidance of complex decision-making and planning. Although previous data support inflated subjective physical effort costs for individuals with schizophrenia, evidence on cognitive effort is mixed. We exploited the methodological advantages of a recently developed cognitive effort-discounting paradigm (Westbrook, Kester, \& Braver, 2013) to examine effort-cost computations in schizophrenia. The paradigm quantifies subjective costs in terms of explicit, continuous discounting of monetary rewards based on parametrically varied demands (levels N of the N-back working memory task), holding objective features of task duration and reward likelihood constant. Both healthy participants (N = 25) and schizophrenia patients (N = 25) showed systematic influences of reward and task demands on choice patterns. Critically, however, participants with schizophrenia discounted rewards more steeply as a function of effort, indicating that effort was more costly for this group. Moreover, discounting varied robustly with symptomatology, such that schizophrenia patients with greater clinically rated negative symptom severity discounted rewards more steeply. These findings extend the current literature on abnormal-effort cost computations in schizophrenia by establishing a clear relationship between the costliness of cognitive effort and negative symptoms.

  abstract   = {Individuals tend to avoid cognitive demand, yet, individual differences appear to exist. Recent evidence from two studies suggests that individuals high in the personality traits Self-Control and Need for Cognition that are related to the broader construct Cognitive Effort Investment are less prone to avoid cognitive demand and show less effort discounting. These findings suggest that cost-benefit models of decision-making that integrate the costs due to effort should consider individual differences in the willingness to exert mental effort. However, to date, there are almost no replication attempts of the above findings. For the present conceptual replication, we concentrated on the avoidance of cognitive demand and used a longitudinal design and latent state-trait modeling. This approach enabled us to separate the trait-specific variance in our measures of Cognitive Effort Investment and Demand Avoidance that is due to stable, individual differences from the variance that is due to the measurement occasion, the methods used, and measurement error. Doing so allowed us to test the assumption that self-reported Cognitive Effort Investment is related to behavioral Demand Avoidance more directly by relating their trait-like features to each other. In a sample of N = 217 participants, we observed both self-reported Cognitive Effort Investment and behavioral Demand Avoidance to exhibit considerable portions of trait variance. However, these trait variances were not significantly related to each other. Thus, our results call into question previous findings of a relationship between self-reported effort investment and demand avoidance. We suggest that novel paradigms are needed to emulate real-world effortful situations and enable better mapping between self-reported measures and behavioral markers of the willingness to exert cognitive effort.},

In two studies, it varied with task difficulty but not age, was predicted by actual effort engagement but not actual success and related to trait interest in effortful activities and proactive control engagement. Children are sensitive to cognitive effort and use it to guide behaviors, suggesting that poor performance may often reflect reluctance to engage cognitive effort rather than low ability.},

However, as an object of scientific study, mental effort has remained rather elusive. Cognitive psychology has provided some tools for understanding how effort impacts performance, by linking effort with cognitive control function. What has remained less clear are the principles that govern the allocation of mental effort. Under what circumstances do people choose to invest mental effort, and when do they decline to do so? And what regulates the intensity of mental effort when it is applied? In new and promising work, these questions are being approached with the tools of behavioural economics. Though still in its infancy, this economic approach to mental effort research has already uncovered important aspects of effort-based decision-making, and points clearly to future lines of inquiry, including some intriguing opportunities presented by recent artificial intelligence research.},

In the present study, we use an innovative decision-making paradigm (COG-ED) to quantify the costs of cognitive effort, a metric of cognitive motivation, across two distinct cognitive domains (working memory and speech comprehension). We hypothesize that cognitive motivation operates similarly within individuals, regardless of domain. Specifically, we test whether individual differences in effort costs are stable across domains, even after controlling for other potential sources of shared individual variation. Conversely, we evaluate whether the costs of cognitive effort across domains may be better explained in terms of other relevant cognitive and personality-related constructs, such as working memory capacity or reward sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Purpose

Objective measures of listening effort have been gaining prominence, as they provide metrics to quantify the difficulty of understanding speech under a variety of circumstances. A key challenge has been to develop paradigms that enable the complementary measurement of subjective listening effort in a quantitatively precise manner. In this study, we introduce a novel decision-making paradigm to examine age-related and individual differences in subjective effort during listening.

Method

Older and younger adults were presented with spoken sentences mixed with speech-shaped noise at multiple signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). On each trial, subjects were offered the choice between completing an easier listening trial (presented at +20 dB SNR) for a smaller monetary reward and completing a harder listening trial (presented at either +4, 0, −4, −8, or −12 dB SNR) for a greater monetary reward. By varying the amount of the reward offered for the easier option, the subjective value of performing effortful listening trials at each SNR could be assessed.

Results

Older adults discounted the value of effortful listening to a greater degree than young adults, opting to accept less money in order to avoid more difficult SNRs. Additionally, older adults with poorer hearing and smaller working memory capacities were more likely to choose easier trials; however, in younger adults, no relationship with hearing or working memory was found. Self-reported measures of economic status did not affect these relationships.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that subjective listening effort depends on factors including, but not necessarily limited to, hearing and working memory. Additionally, this study demonstrates that economic decision-making paradigms can be a useful approach for assessing subjective listening effort and may prove beneficial in future research.},

However, not much is known about the psychometric properties of this task and the current study aims to shed more light on this issue. We first review the current literature on the psychometric properties of the N-back task. With three experiments using task variants with different stimuli and load levels, we then investigate the nature of the N-back task by investigating its relationship to WM, and its role as an inter-individual difference measure. Consistent with previous literature, our data suggest that the N-back task is not a useful measure of individual differences in WM, partly because of its insufficient reliability. Nevertheless, the task seems to be useful for experimental research in WM and also well predicts inter-individual differences in other higher cognitive functions, such as fluid intelligence, especially when used at higher levels of load.},

The paradigm that forms the basis of this experiment is the "n-back" task in which subjects must decide for each letter in a series whether it matches the one presented n items back in the series. This task is of interest because it recruits processes involved in both the storage and manipulation of information in working memory. Variations in task difficulty were accomplished by varying the value of n. As n increased, subjects showed poorer behavioral performance as well as monotonically increasing magnitudes of brain activation in a large number of sites that together have been identified with verbal working-memory processes. By contrast, there was no reliable increase in activation in sites that are unrelated to working memory. These results validate the use of parametric manipulation of task variables in neuroimaging research, and they converge with the subtraction paradigm used most often in neuroimaging. In addition, the data support a model of working memory that includes both storage and executive processes that recruit a network of brain areas, all of which are involved in task performance.},

We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 668 sets of activation coordinates in Talairach space reported in 24 primary studies of n-back task variants manipulating process (location vs. identity monitoring) and content (verbal or nonverbal) of working memory. We found the following cortical regions were activated robustly (voxelwise false discovery rate = 1\%): lateral premotor cortex; dorsal cingulate and medial premotor cortex; dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; frontal poles; and medial and lateral posterior parietal cortex. Subsidiary meta-analyses based on appropriate subsets of the primary data demonstrated broadly similar activation patterns for identity monitoring of verbal stimuli and both location and identity monitoring of nonverbal stimuli. There was also some evidence for distinct frontoparietal activation patterns in response to different task variants. The functional specializations of each of the major cortical components in the generic large-scale frontoparietal system are discussed. We conclude that quantitative meta-analysis can be a powerful tool for combining results of multiple primary studies reported in Talairach space. Here, it provides evidence both for broadly consistent activation of frontal and parietal cortical regions by various versions of the n-back working memory paradigm, and for process- and content-specific frontoparietal activation by working memory.},

Although cognitive resource allocation conceptualized as cognitive effort is assumed to be the key mediator of NFC-specific processing, to date no research has systematically addressed its underpinnings. Using a neurocognitive paradigm and recording event-related potentials associated with bottom-up and top-down-driven aspects of attention, the present research contributes to filling this gap. In Study 1, high-NFC individuals showed larger P3a amplitudes to contextually novel events, indicating greater involuntary (automatic) attention allocation. This effect was replicated in Study 2, where NFC also was positively correlated with the P3b to target stimuli, indicating voluntary (controlled) processes of attention allocation. Thus, our findings provide first evidence for neurophysiological correlates of NFC and can improve the understanding of NFC-specific processing.},

This mismatch between theory and practice appears to arise partly because users of psychological scales are unfamiliar with the psychometric literature on coefficient alpha and partly because alternatives to alpha are not widely known. We present a brief review of the psychometric literature on coefficient alpha, followed by a practical alternative in the form of coefficient omega. To facilitate the shift from alpha to omega, we also present a brief guide to the calculation of point and interval estimates of omega using a free, open source software environment.},

Using a 2‐index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)‐based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker‐Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML‐based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true‐population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2‐index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true‐population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML‐based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true‐population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 38, 23-32.) is the most commonly used measure of Alexithymia (= difficulties identifying and describing one's own feelings). Sixty-three persons (34 psychiatric inpatients, 29 healthy controls) first filled in the TAS-20 and were then interviewed about their interpersonal relationships. Two raters coded the emotional experiences that the participants reported during these interviews. Contrary to expectations, participants with higher TAS-20 scores reported more emotions (particularly negative ones), and more different emotions, questioning the validity of the TAS-20 as a measure of Alexithymia. Based on correlation patterns and a joint factor analysis with two well-established measures of psychopathology, it is concluded that the TAS-20 assesses a general psychological distress factor.

What all strategies have in common is that cognitive control must be exercised in order to implement them. The aim of the present preregistered study was to investigate whether the two ER strategies, expressive suppression and distancing, require different amounts of cognitive effort and whether effort is associated with personality traits. Effort was assessed subjectively via ratings and objectively via pupillometry and heart period. In two studies, N = 110 and N = 52 healthy adults conducted an ER paradigm. Participants used suppression and distancing during inspection of positive and negative pictures. They also had the choice to reapply either of the strategies at the end of the paradigm. Although distancing was more effective in downregulation of subjective arousal (Study 1: p {\textless} .001, = .20; Study 2: p {\textless} .001, = .207), about two thirds reapplied suppression, because it was perceived as less effortful. Effort was rated significantly lower for suppression compared to distancing (Study 1: p = .042, = .04; Study 2: p = .002, = .13). However, differences in effort were not reflected in pupillary data or heart period. Broad and narrow personality traits were neither associated with the preferred strategy nor with subjective or physiological effort measures. Findings suggest that people tend to use the ER strategy that is perceived as less effortful, even though it might not be the most effective strategy.},

  abstract   = {Cognitive or intellectual investment theories propose that the development of intelligence is partially influenced by personality traits, in particular by so-called investment traits that determine when, where, and how people invest their time and effort in their intellect. This investment, in turn, is thought to contribute to individual differences in cognitive growth and the accumulation of knowledge across the life span. We reviewed the psychological literature and identified 34 trait constructs and corresponding scales that refer to intellectual investment. The dispositional constructs were further classified into 8 related trait categories that span the construct space of intellectual investment. Subsequently, we sought to estimate the association between the identified investment traits and indicators of adult intellect, including measures of crystallized intelligence, academic performance (e.g., grade point average), college entry tests, and acquired knowledge. A meta-analysis of 112 studies with 236 coefficients and an overall sample of 60,097 participants indicated that investment traits were mostly positively associated with adult intellect markers. Meta-analytic coefficients ranged considerably, from 0 to .58, with an average estimate of .30. We concluded that investment traits are overall positively related to adult intellect; the strength of investment-intellect associations differs across trait scales and markers of intellect; and investment traits have a diverse, multifaceted nature. The meta-analysis also identified areas of inquiry that are currently lacking in empirical research. Limitations, implications, and future directions are discussed.},

The main objective of this study is to examine - for the first time among employees who sought psychological treatment - the validity of the two most widely used burnout instruments; the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Burnout Measure (BM). Two groups were distinguished: a “burned out” group (n = 71) that suffers from work-related neurasthenia (according to ICD-10 criteria), and a “non-burned out” group (n = 68). Results show that: (1) the validity of the three-factor structure of the MBI and the BM is confirmed; (2) burnout can partly be differentiated from other mental syndromes (e.g., anxiety and depression); and (3) two MBI-scales (Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization) and one BM-scale (Exhaustion) are able to discriminate between burned out and non-burned out employees. The practical implications of these results are discussed.},

From monitoring social events to responding to criminal actions, officers’ abilities to cope to stress are in challenged constantly. Stressful events continuously impact officers’ physical and emotional well-being in detriment of acquiring healthy behaviors or of caring for their physical or mental hygiene. When police activities are neglected or receive negative social perceptions as it occurs in Mexico, it results imperative to explore strategies to overcome the development of illness intrinsically associated to the execution of work activities. This study contributes to the police well-being literature by assessing the appropriateness of using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) in Mexico. Working on data collected from police officers from northern Mexico, psychometric and statistical analysis were conducted to evaluate (1) the appropriateness of using the MBI on these professionals and (2) levels of burnout and their associations to gender and age. Results support considering the MBI as a valid and reliable tool to evaluate burnout symptoms in Mexican officers. Gender and age did not associate significantly to burnout symptomatology. The use of the MBI is recommended to research and explore burnout symptomatology in Mexican officers as strategy to promote mental health programs.},

  abstract   = {The factorial structure of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach and Jackson 1986) was investigated in a sample of 220 Greek teachers and was found to be similar to that reported by Maslach and Jackson. A job satisfaction measure was employed for the investigation of the discriminant validity of the burnout measure. Correlations between job satisfaction and the three burnout dimensions were found to be low to moderate. It is suggested that the relationship and the degree of overlap between emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction require further examination. Greek teachers reported lower levels of burnout on the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scales than teachers in other countries. Finally, younger teachers experienced more emotional exhaustion than older ones and primary education teachers experienced more personal accomplishment and less depersonalization than their counterparts in secondary education.},

In the current report, we present the first direct evidence for a neural analogue of effort discounting. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure neural responses to monetary rewards in the human nucleus accumbens, a structure previously demonstrated to encode reference-dependent reward information. The magnitude of accumbens activation was found to vary with reward outcome, but also with the degree of mental effort demanded to obtain individual rewards. For a fixed level of reward, accumbens was less strongly activated following a high demand for effort than following a lower demand. The magnitude of this effect was noted to correlate with preceding activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a region that has been proposed to monitor information-processing demands and to mediate in the subjective experience of effort.},

In the case of pure insertion and under the additional assumption that the additive random variable is exponentially distributed, a solution is obtained which not only allows estimation of the exponential-rate parameter but also provides a test of the assumptions. The result is shown to be applicable not only when processing is serial but also for certain parallel models. In addition, discrimination between self-terminating and exhaustive search strategies is provided, and in the case of either, both parameter estimation and tests of the model are possible. Extensions to nonexponential models are investigated and a general method of moments solution is outlined. In the case of selective influence a general nonparametric alternative to Sternberg's additive factor method is developed. The problem of empirical estimation and application is then considered. Simulations which place bounds on the type I and II error are reported. Finally the first theorem is provided an illustrative application with data from a memory scanning experiment. The results provide some support for the double assumption of pure insertion and that the additive random variable is distributed exponentially.},

Nevertheless, there exist several methods for outlier exclusion. This poses the question, how these methods differ with respect to recovering the uncontaminated RT distribution. In the present simulation study, two RT distributions with a given population difference were simulated in each iteration. RTs were replaced by outliers following two different approaches. The first approach generated outliers at the tails of the distribution, the second one inserted outliers overlapping with the genuine RT distribution. We applied ten different outlier exclusion methods and tested, how many pairs of distributions significantly differed. Outlier exclusion methods were compared in terms of bias. Bias was defined as the deviation of the proportion of significant differences after outlier exclusion from the proportion of significant differences in the uncontaminated samples (before introducing outliers). Our results showed large differences in bias between the exclusion methods. Some methods showed a high rate of Type-I errors and should therefore clearly not be used. Overall, our results showed that applying an exclusion method based on z-scores / standard deviations introduced only small biases, while the absence of outlier exclusion showed the largest absolute bias.},

Recently, Notebaert and colleagues (Notebaert et al., 2009; Núñez Castellar, Kuhn, Fias, \& Notebaert, 2010) suggested that posterror slowing is a reaction to the infrequent nature of errors. After infrequent errors, posterror slowing was observed but after infrequent correct trials, postcorrect slowing was observed. These data were obtained in a paradigm with trial-by-trial feedback. In this study we tested whether posterror slowing was similar with and without immediate feedback. We manipulated the overall accuracy parametrically per condition (50\%, 70\%, and 90\% accuracy) and predicted an increase in posterror slowing as the accuracy increased. This linear effect was observed with and without immediate feedback. The data are interpreted in terms of an orienting response towards unexpected events.},

This phenomenon, generally referred to as post-error slowing, has been hypothesized to reflect perceptual distraction, time wasted on irrelevant processes, an a priori bias against the response made in error, increased variability in a priori bias, or an increase in response caution. Although the response caution interpretation has dominated the empirical literature, little research has attempted to test this interpretation in the context of a formal process model. Here, we used the drift diffusion model to isolate and identify the psychological processes responsible for post-error slowing. In a very large lexical decision data set, we found that post-error slowing was associated with an increase in response caution and—to a lesser extent—a change in response bias. In the present data set, we found no evidence that post-error slowing is caused by perceptual distraction or time wasted on irrelevant processes. These results support a response-monitoring account of post-error slowing.},

We analysed the impact of these degrees of freedom on the false-positive rate using simulations over real and simulated data. When several preprocessing methods are used in combination, the false-positive rate can easily rise to 17\%. This figure becomes more concerning if we consider that more degrees of freedom are awaiting down the analysis pipeline, potentially making the final false-positive rate much higher.},

Monte Carlo results for theWelch (1947) and Kruskal-Wallis (Kruskal \& Wallis, 1952) tests were also analyzed. The meta-analytic results provided strong support for the robustness of the Type I error rate of the F test when certain assumptions were violated. The F test also showed excellent power properties. However, the Type I error rate of the F test was sensitive to unequal variances, even when sample sizes were equal. The error rate of the Welch test was insensitive to unequal variances when the population distribution was normal, but nonnormal distributions tended to inflate its error rate and to depress its power. Meta-analytic and exact statistical theory results were used to summarize the effects of assumption violations for the tests.},

Meta-analytic techniques were used to summarize the statistical robustness literature on the Type I error properties of the Brown-Forsythe (M. B. Brown A. B. Forsythe, 1974), G. S. James (1951) second-order, Kruskal-Wallis (W. H. Kruskal and W. A. Wallis, 1952), and B. L. Welch (1951) tests. Two variables, based on the theoretical work of G. E. P. Box (1954), are shown to be highly effective in deciding when a particular alternative procedure should be adopted. Based on the meta-analysis findings, it is recommended that researchers gain a clear understanding of the nature of their data before conducting statistical analyses. Of all of the procedures, the James and Welch tests performed best under violations of the variance homogeneity assumption, although their sensitivity to certain types of nonnormality may preclude their use in all data-analytic situations.

  abstract = {When researchers choose to identify and exclude outliers from their data, should they do so across all the data, or within experimental conditions? A survey of recent papers published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General shows that both methods are widely used, and common data visualization techniques suggest that outliers should be excluded at the condition-level. However, I highlight in the present paper that removing outliers by condition runs against the logic of hypothesis testing, and that this practice leads to unacceptable increases in false-positive rates. I demonstrate that this conclusion holds true across a variety of statistical tests, exclusion criterion and cutoffs, sample sizes, and data types, and shows in simulated experiments and in a reanalysis of existing data that by-condition exclusions can result in false-positive rates as high as 43\%. I finally demonstrate that by-condition exclusions are a specific case of a more general issue: Any outlier exclusion procedure that is not blind to the hypothesis that researchers want to test may result in inflated Type I errors. I conclude by offering best practices and recommendations for excluding outliers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract  = {Empirical results hinge on analytical decisions that are defensible, arbitrary and motivated. These decisions probably introduce bias (towards the narrative put forward by the authors), and they certainly involve variability not reflected by standard errors. To address this source of noise and bias, we introduce specification curve analysis, which consists of three steps: (1) identifying the set of theoretically justified, statistically valid and non-redundant specifications; (2) displaying the results graphically, allowing readers to identify consequential specifications decisions; and (3) conducting joint inference across all specifications. We illustrate the use of this technique by applying it to three findings from two different papers, one investigating discrimination based on distinctively Black names, the other investigating the effect of assigning female versus male names to hurricanes. Specification curve analysis reveals that one finding is robust, one is weak and one is not robust at all.},

It now provides a choice of interface; users can write scripts in Python if they choose, while those who prefer to construct experiments graphically can use the new Builder interface. Here we describe the features that have been added over the last 10 years of its development. The most notable addition has been that Builder interface, allowing users to create studies with minimal or no programming, while also allowing the insertion of Python code for maximal flexibility. We also present some of the other new features, including further stimulus options, asynchronous time-stamped hardware polling, and better support for open science and reproducibility. Tens of thousands of users now launch PsychoPy every month, and more than 90 people have contributed to the code. We discuss the current state of the project, as well as plans for the future.},
